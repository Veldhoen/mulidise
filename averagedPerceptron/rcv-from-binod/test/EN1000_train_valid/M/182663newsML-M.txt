U.S. treasuries continued to rally Tuesday , as a higher dollar and hopes of market-friendly inflation and economic news this week pushed bond yields below the 6.50 percent level for the first time in nine months . 
bond prices jumped about three-quarters point to 100-23 / 32 , while its yield fell six basis points to 6.45 percent -- its lowest closing level since March 6 . 
&quot; The question is , &apos; how much further can this rally go ? 
&apos; &quot; wondered Bruce Steinberg , senior economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . 
most market players agreed that there &apos;s still room for the market to rally further should economic data confirm the current low inflation-moderate growth scenario . 
&quot; In the short term , the market can rally at least 50 basis points , &quot; said Liz Miller , portfolio manager at Trevor , Stewart , Burton &amp; Jacobsen Inc . , explaining that &quot; short term &quot; means by year-end . 
she added that in 1995 , both the economy and corporate earnings were stronger than in 1996 , yet bond prices were lower last year . 
&quot; From a fundamental point of view , there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t be at same levels as last year , &quot; Miller said . 
and it was only two months ago the bond was above 7.0 percent . 
&quot; We &apos;ve come a long way in a short time so consolidation needs to take place , &quot; Steinberg said . 
but &quot; if the bond goes down much further , it &apos;s a powerful statement the Federal Reserve has to ease . 
first , the market needs to be sure the Fed won &apos;t tighten anymore . 
the Fed &apos;s policy setting committee meets Wednesday , but economists are unanimous in forecasting no rate increases , with no rate moves seen through year end . 
a Fed seemingly on hold for now helped propel Treasury prices higher Tuesday . 
a rise in the dollar against the mark , hope of market-friendly economic and inflation news this week and prospects of Democrats and Republicans finally meeting in order to continue budget deficit cuts were also cited as factors pushing up treasuries . 
after an early close Friday and a day off Monday , due to the Veterans Day holiday , treasuries caught a bid in overseas trading during the night , which continued into the U.S. session . 
traders said remarks by Bundesbank officials propped up the dollar , which led to foreign buying of treasuries . 
early in the day , two Bundesbank officials said the current dollar-Deutsche mark of below 1.50 was inappropriate . 
later , Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said the dollar was on its way up , a move he welcomed . 
late Tuesday , the dollar was at 1.5065 marks , up from 1.4945 marks Monday . 
meanwhile , the market was gearing up for a wave of key economic reports this week , beginning with the producer price index for October due Wednesday at 0830 est / 1330 GMT . 
in a Reuters survey analysts forecast a 0.2 percent rise in the overall PPI and a 0.1 percent rise in the PPI excluding food and energy . 
the market is also eying Thursday &apos;s data , which include the consumer price report and retail sales data for October . 
players expect a 0.3 percent increase in both the overall and core CPI , and a rise in retail sales of no more than 0.5 percent . 
&quot; If we get those numbers , the market will continue to grind at the upper quadron of the range , &quot; said Kevin Sweeney , head government trader at CoreStates Capital Markets na . 
he noted that there is &quot; significant resistance &quot; at around 6.40 percent , adding that a better than consensus number can push the bond below that level . 
Sweeney said that most of the buying this session came from foreign buyers of five-year notes and higher , helped out bythe dollar &apos;s rise against the mark . 
&quot; We &apos;ve got to price in more than a stable Fed , but an accommodating Fed to drive yields lower on twos , &quot; he explained . 
for now , analysts believe the bond will stick to a 6.25-6.50 percent range . 
&quot; The economy is performing the way the market wants it to perform , &quot; Steinberg said . 
&quot; To go beyond here suggests a weaker economy ... It has slowed , but there &apos;s no recession . 
it &apos;s just correcting after excesses from first part of the year .
