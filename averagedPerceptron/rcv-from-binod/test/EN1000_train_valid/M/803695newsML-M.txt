Singapore &apos;s beleagured stock market rallied on Friday on rumours the government might scrap a system of dual share listings for strategic blue chip companies . 
the main benchmark share measure , the Straits Times Industrials Index ( STII ) , surged more than two percent on rises in a range of top firms , including Singapore Airlines ( SIA ) and Singapore Press ( SPH ) . 
by the 0430 GMT lunchtime close , the STII had recovered to 1,935.16 points , up 2.29 percent or 43.39 points on the day but against a peak of just over 2,500 points in February 1996 . 
Fund managers said the gap between the local and foreign listings -- which has been the equivalent of 100 percent of the local share price for some stocks -- was likely to continue to narrow unless the government squashed rumours that dual listings would be abolished . 
&quot; As it is , the government seems content not to do anything , and as the companies themselves don &apos;t want to decide , the market itself seems to be deciding for them , &quot; said Lim Eng Hai , head of research at Singapore brokerage J.M. 
Sassoon . 
&quot; If the gap narrows far enough the issue will disappear and the companies can formally abolish the distinction without upsetting anyone , &quot; he added . 
until last week , 17 local companies deemed strategically important by the government had separate listings for local and overseas investors . 
but the ST group announced on August 8 it would merge the listings for its subsidiary ST Computer Systems &amp; Services and followed this on Thursday by scrapping the dual system for its four other listed units . 
analysts said the ST group appeared to have accepted the argument that the dual listing system was inefficient and hampered the development of the market . 
the Singapore government , through its private investment arm , Temasek Holdings , and other state-run bodies , already controls or owns a majority of the companies with dual listings . 
&quot; Dual listing is a thing of the past , &quot; said Lim . 
&quot; And anyway it isn &apos;t necessary . 
you could easily allow foreigners to buy local shares , but just not give them voting rights , or keep a limit on their ownership if you wanted to . 
most analysts felt scrapping the distinction between the two listings would benefit the Singapore stock market overall . 
&quot; In the longer term , it should be positive for the Singapore market because foreign funds will have access to more value here . 
buying into Singapore will be cheaper and more attractive , &quot; said Gandhi .
