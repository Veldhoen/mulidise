U.S. spot products prices were seen easing moderately tracking futures Monday morning , with heating oil still battling downward pressure in the Northeast because of improved supply . 
February NYMEX heat has fallen almost three cents a gallon since last Wednesday amid a NYMEX selloff despite freezing weather on the East Coast and bitter cold in the Midwest . 
&quot; Heat is still very well offered in the ( New York ) Harbor , &quot; one trader said Monday , predicting more tough days ahead for distillates . 
traders on Friday cited at least four Gulf Coast distillate cargoes heading for New York Harbor remaining unclaimed . 
&quot; These cargoes need homes but haven &apos;t found them yet , &quot; a distillate broker said , adding two were British Petroleum shipments from the Gulf Coast and another was from Vitol S.A. &apos; s refinery in Come by Chance , Newfoundland . 
reached late afternoon , a BP source said one of the Gulf ships had not yet been loaded , adding the other cargo might be diverted to Europe because of more-favorable prospects there . 
Vitol was not immediately available for comment . 
above-average imports of European gasoline into the harbor would likely put pressure on prices this week , traders added .
