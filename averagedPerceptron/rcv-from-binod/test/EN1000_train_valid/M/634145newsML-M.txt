while the short-term outlook for September U.S. Treasury bond futures remains positive , the contract is likely to falter at tough resistance just above the market , chartists said Tuesday . 
futures probed above 110-00 for a second straight session Tuesday , reaching a high so far of 110-02 , and probably will extend gains this week , technicians said . 
the contract recently was trading at 109-30 , up a mild 6 / 32 on the day . 
September bond futures have been grinding toward a target of 110-09 , the May 13 high , in a rebound from the low of 105-30 reached on April 11 . 
&quot; We &apos;re trying to get up there , and I think we will , &quot; said CIA Lallas , a technical analyst for mms International Inc . she noted that daily stochastics remain bullish and are creeping upward , bolstering the case for further gains . 
Futhermore , the contract last week decisively rejected support at 108-04 , the 50 percent retracement of the 1-1 / 2-month rally , and the market has retained a &quot; buy dips &quot; mentality , Lallas said . 
looming beyond the upside goal of 110-09 , however , is important resistance that could soon turn the rally back , the analysts said . 
&quot; We have to work up into 110-12 , and then we &apos;re going to have a major setback , &quot; said Joe Plauche , financial futures analyst for Dean Witter . 
he predicted September futures would slide to the 109-00 area after faltering at 110-12 . 
the latter is the projected high of an extended fifth-wave movement off the May 27 low of 108-05 . 
Lallas said she expected the contract to reach 110-15 , the 62 percent retracement of the 3-1 / 2-month downmove , before stumbling . 
&quot; I don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to be able to get a close over that level , &quot; she said .
