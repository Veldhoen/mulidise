Taiwan share prices skyrocketed in late Thursday trade as investors ignored new credit limits to lay in red-hot electronics shares , driving the stock index past 9,800 points , brokers said . 
with 55 minutes left , at 0305 GMT , the index was up 301.31 points or 3.16 percent at 9,845.87 , a seven-year intraday high . 
turnover was heavy at 175.69 billion . 
&quot; The margin-buying credit limit is no longer a concern . 
most individual investors are buying heavily in electronics after the record Nasdaq rally on Wall Street , &quot; said Jeffrey Liang of Nomura Securities . 
to avoid excessive credit expansion during rallies , Taiwan long ago set benchmarks at 6,000 , 7,200 , 8,400 and 9,600 at which margin-buying limits must be trimmed by 10 percent . 
brokers said the rally on Wall Street , partularly the rise of high-tech-driven Nasdaq composite , contributed to a 5.75 percent rise in Taiwan &apos;s closely watched electronic sector . 
&quot; Obviously the sharp performance of Taiwan &apos;s electronics was affected by Nasdaq , &quot; said Joe Chiou of Taiwan Securities Investment . 
technology stocks extended their recent run in Wall Street , driving the Nasdaq to its biggest single-day point rise . 
many analysts have said they expected Taiwan &apos;s index to surpass 10,000 in the third quarter , but have cautioned that political worries likely would pull it back from that level . 
a June 11-12 Reuters poll of 10 Taiwan analysts yielded an average forecast that the weighted index would end 1997 at 8,620 . 
the index hit its all-time high of 12,495.34 on February 10 , 1990 , then plunged 80 percent over the next eight months . 
on Thursday , most electronic shares had risen the daily seven percent limit .
