Polish shares edged up in stable trade , overshadowed by NFIs surging in heavy turnovers in the second day of their bourse trade , and analysts expected them to keep drawing investor attention from other stocks . 
the main market &apos;s WIG index rose 45.1 points , or 0.3 percent , to 16.482.1 , and turnover was stable at 126.6 million zlotys ( $ 38.4 million ) on all three markets as 43 issues fell , 39 rose and 23 were flat . 
analysts said the all-share WIG index was likely to fall in profit-taking on Monday , after it rose 3.1 percent in the last three sessions while National Investment Funds could slow their advance . 
&quot; As far as NFIs are concerned there might be some cooling ( on Monday ) , but they will still draw most of the attention , &quot; said Czeslaw Pospieszynski of PBI brokerage . 
analysts said the NFIs were attracting speculators interest as the market , which has been swinging in the sideways drift since mid-March , did not offer good opportunities to make quick profits in the near future . 
they said the NFIs , very difficult to valuate , were ideal for speculators , but said large turnovers suggested institutions were also buying . 
national Investment Funds NIF index rose 6.4 percent to 170.3 points and NFI turnover doubled to 69.7 million zlotys ( $ 21.2 million ) with 14 NFIs rising and one staying flat . 
analysts were surprised by the limited growth of mass privatisation NFI units representing the funds &apos; shares , one in each fund , and expected their further growth to match NIF index , calculated as a sum of NFI shares . 
the units rose 3.3 percent to 155.0 zlotys ( $ 47 ) at the regular session and extended their gains to 157.5 zlotys ( $ 47.7 ) in the continuous trade .
