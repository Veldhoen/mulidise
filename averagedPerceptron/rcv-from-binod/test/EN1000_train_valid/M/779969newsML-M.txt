basis bids for hard red winter wheat were steady Tuesday but several High Plains grain dealers said they expected an increase later today after U.S. Gulf bids firmed . 
&quot; Gulf basis bid improved yesterday by about three cents so I expect the interior basis to come up by the end of the day , &quot; a Kansas merchandiser said . 
&quot; It &apos;s been fairly slow , &quot; another Kansas merchant said . 
&quot; Not many rail cars were offered out yesterday and the few that were went to Kansas City . 
a third Kansas dealer said he did not expect much farmer selling on Tuesday despite strength in Gulf bids . 
&quot; Farmer selling was pretty slow yesterday and we &apos;re not looking for much today , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The Gulf values changed a little bit yesterday but nothing major , not enough to shake much ( wheat ) loose . 
basis values in cents / Bu against KCBT wheat , cash = dollars / Bu .
