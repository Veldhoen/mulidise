French market research firm Jacques Chahine Finance has set an objective for the blue-chip CAC-40 index of 2,650 points assuming a very cautious scenario of 1.7 percent growth of French gross domestic product for 1997 . 
the forecast also assumes interest rates of 5.5 percent . 
assuming two percent growth , which is still below most market forecasts , the CAC-40 index could reach 2,900 to 3,000 by year &apos;s end , and 2,800 in the medium term , it said in a study . 
&quot; The French market is the one showing the greatest recovery among European countries , &quot; it said . 
&quot; Even if price-earnings ratio seem high ... at 18.6 times 1997 ( earnings ) for the CAC-40 , this figure does not seem excessive in relation to very low interest rates under 5.5 percent , &quot; it said . 
it said it expected French blue-chip results to outpace those of other European firms , with 20 percent profit growth seen in continental Europe and 22.7 percent growth for the CAC-40 companies . 
it estimated estimated earnings of the CAC-40 would rebound 130 percent in 1996 from depressed 1995 levels .
