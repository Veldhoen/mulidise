CBOT rice futures ended lower on Tuesday , keying off of the USDA weekly crop update which showed an improvement in crop ratings , traders said . 
USDA on Monday said 82 percent of the U.S. rice crop was rated good to excellent , up from 78 percent last week . 
&quot; We saw an improvement in the crop , &quot; a trader said . 
&quot; We &apos;re still not on par with last year &apos;s beautiful crop but we &apos;ve got more acres to work with . 
pit sources also noted an increase in hedge-related selling which further pressured the market . 
but export demand appeared to be picking up . 
traders noted Iraq was tendering for 30,000 tonnes of U.S. long grain rice in an oil-for-food deal for October shipment , several exporters said . 
Iraq was once a major customer but had not purchased U.S. rice since the 1991 Gulf War , traders said . 
rice ended 4-1 / 2 to one cent per cwt lower with September down 4-1 / 2 at $ 9.71 . 
volume was estimated by CBOT at 600 lots , compared with Monday &apos;s actual volume of 279 lots .
