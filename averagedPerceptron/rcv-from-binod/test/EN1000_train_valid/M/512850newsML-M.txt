Lithuanian shares continued to stumble on Wednesday as investors waited for first quarter results , dealers said . 
&quot; The prospects this week don &apos;t look that great , &quot; said one dealer , summing up the bearish mood of market players . 
external factors were mixed , with some Eastern European bourses gaining while others , including neighbouring Latvia and Slovenia , fell . 
Lithuanian Gas continued its slide , falling to 1.79 litas from 1.98 litas in trade of 219,000 litas and dealers said it would probably ease some more . 
dealers said the market was responding to the state-run gas firm &apos;s recent statements concerning its 1996 results , which show a loss of at least 78 million litas . 
final results have not been released yet as the company &apos;s shareholders &apos; meeting , originally scheduled for Monday , was postponed for two weeks because of a dispute with the auditors over legal documents . 
the session &apos;s few gainers included Birzai Dairy , which rose 2.15 percent to 9.50 litas in trade of 150,500 litas and cardboard producer Medienos Plaushas , which advanced to 13.10 litas from 12.80 litas in trade of almost 21,000 litas . 
dealers said both firms looked to be a bit underpriced . 
the long-term outlook for the equities market looks brighter , with a group of senior Western fund managers arriving in Vilnius Wednesday for a two-day fact finding visit .
