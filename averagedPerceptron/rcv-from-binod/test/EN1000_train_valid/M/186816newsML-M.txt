Pakistani cotton rates were mixed on Wednesday amid selective buying by spinners but are likely to edge up on Thursday , dealers said . 
&quot; Some of the major spinners had halted buying to bring the prices down , &quot; dealer Nasim Usman said . 
but ginners resisted the move and most spinners are likely to lose patience and enter the market to buy for their immediate requirements , he said .
