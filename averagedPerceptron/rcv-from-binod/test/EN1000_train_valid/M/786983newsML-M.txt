U.S. stock index futures closed sharply lower , jolted by fears that the U.S. inflation rate was rising , traders and analysts said . 
several traders expressed nervousness ahead of next week &apos;s U.S. July Producer Price Index ( PPI ) and the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , which will be released on Wednesday and Thursday , respectively . 
ideas that the U.S. economy was picking up steam lifted yields on the 30-year T-bond to 6.64 percent and sent September Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 futures skidding nearly 30 points around midday . 
after the close , San Fransisco Federal Reserve president Robert Parry said the July U.S. economic data was &quot; too vague &quot; to conclude that the economy was picking up steam . 
another floor trader said there was one trade at 926.25 , the 30-point intermediate daily downside limit from Thursday &apos;s pit settlement of 956.26 . 
however , several bids at the 926.65 area were unfilled , forcing the cancellation of the trade at 926.25 , he said . 
Short-covering immediately emerged at the 926.65 area , with two firms alone lifting September above the 930.00 level . 
however , some traders , spooked by the velocity of the drop in U.S. T-bond and U.S. stock prices , started looking for the contract to fall to the second intermediate daily limit of 45 points . 
such a fall would have put September near key support at 911.25 . 
the contract continued its poor performance into the close , as a rash of selling bombarded the cash S &amp; P index , they said . 
in addition , the contract remained unable to retrace losses above a minor retracement level of 940.50 , barely nudging through a support zone at 935.00 to 934.00 . 
arbitrage programs activity was light in the afternoon . 
arbitrage buy programs were seen at 5.50 points over cash . 
arbitrage sell programs were expected at a premium of 3.50 points . 
fair value stood at 4.13 points . 
at the end of pit trade , September S &amp; P 500s were off 19.85 at 936.40 , a one-week low , KCBT Value Lines were 12.50 lower at 835.50 , new composites were 9.05 lower at 485.05 , Midcap 400s were 4.75 lower at 312.75 , Russell 2000s were down 7.00 at 414.50 and Nikkeis were 135 lower at 19,175 .
