Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT ) soybean contracts climbed strongly on Monday on the exchange &apos;s Project A after-hours system in Asian trade in line with a sharp rise in wheat futures , dealers said . 
the May soymeal futures contract were seen at a session high of $ 280 a ton , up $ 5.20 from Friday &apos;s $ 274.80 , but had retreated to $ 278.20 late in the afternoon . 
&quot; Trading in soybean futures on the Chicago market will continue to be volatile , &quot; a soybean trader in Japan said . 
&quot; We will start buying soymeal before the Chicago market calms down . 
&quot; Our buyers are looking for other oilseeds now instead of high-priced soymeal , &quot; a Seoul-based trader added . 
Japanese dealers said the rise in Project A &quot; reflects a correction in reaction to the oversold conditions last Friday . 
fundamental sentiment remains bullish as U.S. soybean stocks remain low . 
several feed mill companies in South Korea were said to be seeking 15,000 tonnes of rapeseed meal every month beginning in August , one dealer said . 
two South Korean buying groups invited tenders on Monday for 38,800 tonnes of cottonseed meal for arrival from July through September to three South Korean ports . 
another group known as the Big Feed Mills was said to be also seeking 20,000-30,000 tonnes of tapioca for shipment from June onwards , the traders added . 
in Taiwan , the Kaohsiung division of Taiwan &apos;s breakfast soybean Procurement Association was considering placing a tender for a 54,000-tonne shipment of soybeans for June delivery . 
the Philippines , on the other hand , is not expected to enter the market this week after a recent purchase of 15,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans earlier this month , dealers said .
