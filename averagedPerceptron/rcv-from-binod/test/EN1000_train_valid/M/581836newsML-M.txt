world coffee prices hit new highs on Wednesday in a raging bull market as producer nations gave a warning of tight supply . 
the blistering rally in coffee contrasted with a rather lacklustre day in other commodity markets , with the exception of palladium and platinum which , like coffee , are enjoying fund interest . 
the news that Latin American supply is tight and American stocks of the higher quality arabica coffee beans are at 20-year lows has sent speculators on a buying spree . 
new York coffee futures on Wednesday extended the longest sustained rally in two decades . 
they were at the highest since frost last hit Brazil , back in 1994 , even though this year &apos;s season for frost scares has yet to begin . 
the July contract for the high quality arabica bean traded in New York rose on Wednesday to life-of-contract highs at $ 2.48 per pound . 
Arabica futures have doubled since the start of the year . 
in London the benchmark July robusta coffee futures contract jumped to $ 1,885 a tonne in early trading to notch up the second new year high in two days , with traders saying the rally was far from over . 
profit taking later in the day pulled it down to hover ahead by $ 53 at $ 1,870 a tonne . 
Colombia &apos;s National Coffee Growers &apos; Federation said it was finding it hard to meet export commitments . 
&quot; There &apos;s very little coffee in Colombia . 
the federation is having enormous difficulties meeting its commitments , &quot; its head , Jorge Cardenas , said on Tuesday . 
Colombia is the number two coffee seller after Brazil . 
&quot; There is no more coffee in the producer countries , &quot; Guy-Alain Gauze , commodity Minister of Ivory Coast , told Reuters in a Singapore interview . 
&quot; We are really facing problems with production . 
Robustas , used mainly in soluble or instant blends , have risen by more than 50 percent since the start of the year on worries about tight supply and dwindling stocks . 
the rally spells bad news for the coffee drinkers of Europe and America who have already suffered several price rises in the supermarkets so far this year . 
Western firms that have already had to lift retail prices include Folgers in the United States and Douwe Egberts , owned by U.S. giant Sara Lee Corp , in Europe . 
on Wednesday , Douwe Egberts announced it was not about to up the price again but would not rule out further rises in the future . 
on the London metal Exchange , copper closed $ 3 down at $ 2,414 a tonne after a rather uneventful day &apos;s trading in the ring . 
with the exception of zinc , which grazed recent highs of $ 1,340 a tonne before turning back , other base metals were unchanged across the board . 
the platinum group metals continued to set the pace in the precious metals sector on Wednesday with gold and silver lagging behind . 
dealers said the rampantly high platinum and palladium markets were providing most of the sector &apos;s support . 
&quot; If the PGMs were $ 20- $ 30 lower , gold would be back in the mid $ 330s , &quot; one dealer said . 
gold hovered below key resistance of $ 350 an ounce for the second day running . 
several dealers mentioned the markets being firmer now than on Monday when Russian officials announced they had opened export contract talks with Japanese trade houses after a delay of over five months . 
platinum was indicated at $ 394.00 / $ 395.00 , up $ 6.00 and palladium was $ 5.00 firmer at $ 175.00 / $ 176.00 . 
in other markets on Wednesday , benchmark North Sea Brent Blend crude oil was down 20 cents in the afternoon after a rise of almost $ 2 per barrel over the last five days . 
wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade drifted several cents per bushel lower on sterling strength . 
London cocoa futures closed lower with July dipping below psychological support at 1,000 stg per tonne .
