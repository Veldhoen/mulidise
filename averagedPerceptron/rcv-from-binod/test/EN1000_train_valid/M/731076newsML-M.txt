German shares weakened in early trade on Tuesday , dragged lower by losses on heavyweight insurance shares , as the market drew breath after its sharp dollar-driven gains on Monday . 
&quot; It &apos;s time to take stock , &quot; said a Frankfurt dealer . 
&quot; If the market keeps going like a rocket , we could be heading for a somersault backward . 
the dollar &apos;s drop from Monday &apos;s highs was the main trigger . 
the U.S. currency , which had traded above or close to 1.79 marks throughout German share trade on Monday , was trading clearly below that level early on Tuesday . 
dollar stength invariably boosts the German share market , since top German industrial corporations are mainly strongly dependent on exports to the U.S. 
export-driven shares weakened on Tuesday , with carmaker Daimler-Benz AG , for example , down 1.10 marks at 147.80 marks . 
both shares had shot higher on Monday , with Munich Re rising nearly seven percent in bourse trade , after it reported higher than expected earnings for the 1996 / 1997 business year . 
Munich Re was down 90 marks , or 1.4 percent , at 6,340 marks while Allianz was down 1.7 percent at 425.10 marks . 
despite the weak start , dealers said they did not expect any heavy selling pressure on the market , predicting that the DAX would trade in a range between 4,100 and 4,150 points . 
&quot; This is not a consolidation , it &apos;s a break , &quot; said one trader . 
&quot; The money will keep coming in .
