a mixed employment report last week clouded U.S. money managers &apos; outlook on debt allocations , according to a survey by Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc . 
&quot; The data suggest that the September employment release had varied effects on money manager perceptions of the appropriate portfolio structure , &quot; the report said . 
&quot; Neither duration exposure nor cash holdings changed to any significant degree , &quot; the report added . 
in the week ended October 8 , the survey &apos;s bear / bull index arithmetic reading fell to 4.16 from 4.36 the previous week , while the asset-weighted number slumped to 4.03 , down from 4.39 in the previous period , according the report . 
a number above 5.00 is seen as indicating investors are mostly long on the market . 
the cash / assets ratio rose to 7.08 percent from 7.06 percent . 
duration bogey held mostly steady at 4.06 on an arithmetic basis and 4.68 on a weighted basis . 
duration bogey is the level of asset or liability duration sought in the management of a portfolio . 
duration refers to a portfolio &apos;s average maturity and is used by portfolio managers to calculate exposure to risk . 
twenty-four percent of the portfolio managers polled said they were planning to be active in the coming week , up sharply from 4 percent the week before . 
the bear / bull index collected among those intending to be active was 4.17 , down from 5.0 the previous week . 
the Stone &amp; McCarthy survey is conducted by the research firm weekly . 
it includes 25 market participants with total assets of about $ 100 billion , the firm said .
