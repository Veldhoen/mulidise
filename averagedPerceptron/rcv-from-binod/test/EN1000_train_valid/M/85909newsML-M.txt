UK gilts will struggle to win any independence from mighty U.S. treasuries this week as bond markets await early U.S. economic evidence for September to see if the Federal Reserve was right to leave rates on hold . 
but this will be dwarfed by speculation on the level of the U.S. September non-farm payroll on Friday . 
&quot; Any sign from the data that the Fed should have raised rates will knock the U.S. which is looking very vulnerable , &quot; said Peter Osler , analyst at GNI . 
and if the U.S. tumbles , European bond markets will put up little resistance , traders said . 
the consensus forecast suggests the payroll rose 166,000 compared with August &apos;s 250,000 . 
a stronger figure would wipe out the gains U.S. and European markets locked in following the Federal Reserve &apos;s controversial decision to leave rates on hold at last Tuesday &apos;s FOMC meeting . 
even gilts , which had been weak and underperforming , ratcheted up nearly two points . 
profit-taking eroded some of the gains on Friday and by midday on Monday , December futures stood half a point down from last week &apos;s highs at 108-18 . 
but despite the rally , the UK market made only partial headway in reversing the recent tide of underperformance . 
and economists said this week &apos;s prospects are not much better . 
&quot; The miserable relative performance against high yeilding markets will continue as long as the government carries on squabbling over EMU , &quot; said Richard Warburton at William de Broe . 
&quot; And this is in spite of the inevitable question marks over the true ability of countries like Spain to converge economically . 
Swedish bonds are trading around 30 basis points through gilts with Spanish bonds closing fast . 
Gilt underperformance was prompted by the Dublin Ecofin summit which allowed the process towards European monetary union to take a small step forward . 
bond markets likely to join the single currency in the first wave rallied while gilts , dogged by ruling Conservative Party disputes over whether Britain should join , slithered lower . 
the yield spread against Bunds at 10-years stood at 173 basis points in midday Monday trade versus a high of 183 last week . 
&quot; The range for that spread looks set to stay at 170 to 180 for a while from 150 to 160 a few weeks ago , &quot; said Osler . 
&quot; The recent talks and budgets in Europe have served to give the impression that the others are moving ahead towards conversion while the UK is standing still . 
and with the Conservative Party conference starting next week , the chances of a rapid resolution are small . 
senior Tories traditionally play to the patriotic sympathies of the rank-and-file party members who attend the conference . 
that could serve to open up the split and damage gilts further . 
traders said the risks are on the upside . 
&quot; Recent evidence from surveys in particular is showing consumer demand is finally filtering through to the manufacturing sector , &quot; said a trader at a GEMM . 
but there might be good news on prices . 
last month , the prices index leapt to 41.5 from 38.5 . 
&quot; If that component stays steady , gilts could take some comfort , &quot; the trader said .
