average Croatian citizens know little and care even less about investment in shares and only every eighth one would venture his lean savings into profitable but risky purchases , a local newspaper reported on Monday . 
according to results of a poll conducted by daily Vecernji list in capital Zagreb , some 41 percent of the population have never even considered buying stocks despite a recent expansion of the country &apos;s capital market , well covered in the media . 
around one fifth said they had taken advantage of the country &apos;s privatisation process , launched five years ago , to buy shares in known companies . 
another 25 percent of those interviewed said they might be tickled but were looking for sure profit . 
but the poll showed only a half of the current shareholders were lucky enough to invest in profitable business and are receiving dividends . 
as many as three in four are not following stock market developments , dominated by a quick price rise , to enhance their initial investment as most are still paying off the shares . 
the majority of small investors who took part in company buyouts were current and former employees . 
even with a discount of up to 50 percent , the majority could not afford to buy shares in cash but rather agreed to pay for them in monthly instalments over 20 years .
