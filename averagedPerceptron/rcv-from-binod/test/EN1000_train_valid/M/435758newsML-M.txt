precious metal prices turned lower on Wednesday afternoon led by palladium . 
dealers said an unconfirmed report from Moscow that Russia could resume shipments of palladium later this month brought out selling which spread through platinum to the gold market . 
palladium exports from Russia - the leading producer- to Japan which is the biggest consumer have been held up by delays in negotiating a new supply contract . 
palladium fixed at $ 151.50 per ounce this afternoon , down from $ 154.75 earlier and a close of $ 157.50 / $ 158.50 last night which followed its highest fix since July 10 , 1995 of $ 157.50 . 
&quot; The report makes some sense . 
Russia has to start exporting at some stage , &quot; one dealer said . 
gold prices also eased back to fix at $ 351.40 against $ 353.25 earlier but silver was unchanged at $ 5.23 / $ 5.25 . 
but platinum slipped to under $ 380.00 briefly having fixed two dollars below the morning fix at $ 380.50 . 
last month a Russian official in Tokyo read a statement from export agency general director Valery Borisoglebsky saying , &quot; We can say for certain that no export of palladium will be made in March and we do not know when the talks will take place &quot; . 
palladium was bought late in New York for Nymex &apos;s June contract to close $ 6.00 per ounce higher at $ 161.25 . 
it then went the 22-yen daily limit up on Tocom on overseas buying before opening barely changed in Europe . 
a senior platinum group metals ( PGM ) markets analyst said it was possible spot sales of PGMs could start from Russia this month but contract sales to Japan were unlikely . 
&quot; My information from Japan this morning was that there were still no negotiations taking place , &quot; the analyst said . 
&quot; Nobody has priced the metal for the first delivery which means it would have to be priced in April for delivery on May 1 , &quot; he added . 
traditionally Russian export contracts are priced on the basis of the average for the preceding month . 
to hedge against losses , the buyer sells metal each day during the pricing month to cover his purchase at the average price . 
palladium is used in electronics , chemicals , dental alloys and in catalytic converters to remove the toxins from exhaust fumes . 
its price has been climbing steadily since late last year as Japanese consumers have had to come to the dealer market to pick up supplies of metal .
