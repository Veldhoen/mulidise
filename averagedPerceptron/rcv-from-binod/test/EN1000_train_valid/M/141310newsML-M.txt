prices for U.S. West Coast light crude ended $ 1 lower , tracking a collapse in West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) , while regional differentials stayed flat on a lack of buying interest . 
the collapse in the roll came as traders sold WTI grade in favour of lighter ones . 
West Coast traders looked to increase purchases of Line 63 crudes after Arco said they would allow more crude through the prorated line during November .
