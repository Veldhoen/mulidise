market sentiment was lifted by the strengthening dollar and underpinned by firmer German debt . 
&quot; The dollar is picking up and that is helping to support the market . 
to be honest I think we need to see a bit of profit-taking , a bit of consolidation . 
the market feels a bit toppy at the moment , &quot; a trader said . 
the market of late has been trading in or around record levels and traders said there was evidence that of a touch of vertigo at these heights without solid fundamentals to back up the bullish sentiment . 
the main focus of share trade in the morning was Deutsche Telekom , which fell after German newspaper Handelsblatt reported in its Wednesday edition the Bonn government might consider selling some if its Telekom shares . 
the paper reported that the Bonn government wants to sell a portion of its nearly 75 percent stake in Telekom this year as part of efforts to pare back the budget deficit . 
the news drove the shares nearly four and a half percent lower at one point , but the share recovered somewhat and was trading at 38.98 marks , was down 85 pfennigs , or 2.09 percent , at 38.92 marks . 
&quot; I think that today we are going to see a Telekom bourse , but the market is proving resistant , &quot; a Frankfurt trader said , adding and said that volumes were enormous early on , but that 38 marks was proving to be a point of massive resistance . 
the trader said that if it was true that Bonn was planning to sell off the share , then the earnings potential for the Telekom share was limited . 
however , dealers insisted that the fundamental figures for Telekom remained good . 
&quot; All in all , I think the market could well absorb a big block of Telekom shares , &quot; the trader said . 
other traders were sceptical whether Bonn would actually bring the shares to market in the end . 
&quot; We &apos;re also seeing more buyers than sellers at the lower levels , &quot; said one trader . 
BASF was up 1.29 percent at 68.10 marks , while Schering was up 1.69 percent at 57 marks . 
Volkswagen performed best among the car stocks , up 1.26 percent at 165 marks . 
finance stocks were also in favour pre-bourse . 
Deutsche Bank was up 1.45 marks , or 1.51 percent at 97.67 marks , Commerzbank was up 65 pfennigs or 1.36 percent at 48.30 marks while Dresdner was up 78 pfennigs , or 1.33 percent , at 59.38 marks .
