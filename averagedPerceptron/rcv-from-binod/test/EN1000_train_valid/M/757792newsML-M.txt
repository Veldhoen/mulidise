bids for dark northern spring wheat fell slightly as MGE September wheat dropped two cents . 
&quot; This spring , part of the state ( North Dakota ) was very dry and with those drought conditions , a lot of the durum did not come in very even , &quot; said Wayne Carlson , director of livestock for the North Dakota Department of Agriculture .
