the following are extracts from a report titled &quot; India markets : buying opportunity ? 
&quot; by Rupa K.Bose , analyst at Paribas Capital Markets , Singapore issued on October 11 , 1996 : 
Indian stock markets could fall further in the next two to three months , offering a buying opportunity . 
the market could rise six to 12 months from now on easier liquidity . 
the apparent reason for the recent fall in the Indian market are not hard to find . 
there has been little good news since the budget imposed a 12.9 percent minimum tax on all Indian companies . 
political upsets have followed , the investigation against former prime minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao is the most obvious . 
investors were concerned about the stability and staying power of the current ruling coalition . 
most recently , fears that the Indian economy is slowing down discouraged investors . 
underlying all this are two factors that concern us more : probable underperformance by Indian companies in the first half of the March 1997 fiscal year , and even more critically , the high real interest rates . 
despite many downward estimate revisions earlier this year , analysts and the market may be disappointed with half-year earnings that will be announced in the reporting season beginning later this month . 
meanwhile , back in New Delhi , good intentions to reduce the government deficit seem to get the usual indifferent results . 
this leaves policy makers with a balancing act between a tight money policy that holds down inflation -- but limits funds to the private sector and possibly risks growth , and loose money supply that risks inflation . 
the demand for money continued high and resulted in real interest rates in the region of 8.0-12.0 percent , depending on what one realistically assumed inflation to be , it said . 
what the Indian stock market needs to revive it is a bout of inflation -- or at least , the fear of it . 
as is sometimes the case with stock markets , there &apos;s a certain inverse logic here . 
from a foreign investors &apos; viewpoint , inflation would eventually push down the value of the rupee , which would slide against hard currencies - but the gain in the stock market as local investors switched out of debt into equity would probably more than outweigh exchange losses . 
this bout of inflation could well happen . 
until the risk of an economic slowdown became real , the Indian government did not need to consider the trade-off between inflation ( via money supply ) and growth . 
it could afford to avoid the debate about a suitable inflation rate for India : some observers argue that , given the frictions in the economy , any rate consistently below 8.0 percent would be likely to impact growth . 
now , we think it may have to act to reduce the interest rates and the only way it really can do that , despite the fact that the financial sector is still regulated , is to ease the money supply . 
assuming the government uses the busy season credit policy to ease the money supply , liquidity could start to feed into the system in about three to six months . 
meanwhile , we think many companies will find second half better than the first half . 
investors would have already factored in the impact of the minimum tax . 
in any case , within six months , investors would focus on 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) . 
political uncertainty will not necessarily block a market rise . 
if sentiment is positive , investors may well consider that the political downside is limited . 
any reasonable political party will recognise the economic imperatives of the situation and none wish to roll back liberalisation .
