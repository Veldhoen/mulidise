Malaysian shares fell to a seven-and-a-half month low on Monday after leveraged retail investors were asked to top up their portfolios wth cash , and a foreign institutional sell-off , dealers and analysts said . 
at the close , the benchmark composite Index of 100 large-capitalised stocks fell 37.27 points , or 3.27 percent , to 1,101.09 . 
&quot; There &apos;s a general downrating of Malaysia by foreign institutions on the perception that earnings growth among banks and property companies will slow down , &quot; said Ramlan Ahmad , senior manager at fund managers Commerce MGI . 
Malaysia &apos;s central bank announced measures in late March to curb lending to the property sector for speculative purposes . 
&quot; Foreign institutions want to get out , but they can &apos;t . 
there are no buyers , &quot; said a dealer at a local bank-backed brokerage house . 
&quot; The market is reacting to Wall Street &apos;s fall on Friday , but locally it &apos;s margin calls that are affecting the market , &quot; said Ooi Soon Beng , head of research at Inter-Pacific Securities . 
Sime Darby fell 50 cents to 7.70 ringgit , while MBf Capital dropped 20 to 3.88 . 
both companies have large exposures to the property market , said analysts . 
Fund managers said they were using the fall as an opportunity to buy quality blue-chip stocks . 
&quot; We &apos;re not panicking here , &quot; said Robert Coombe , executive director at Commerce Asset Fund Managers . 
&quot; If you &apos;re not geared and not in the Second Board , you should be buying , &quot; he added . 
&quot; With a prospective 1997 p.e. 
( price-earnings multiple ) of around 18 times , you can &apos;t go wrong , &quot; said Ramlan . 
the Kuala Lumpur stock market has historically traded at a p.e. 
of between 20 and 21 times , analysts said . 
the market would take around two to three months to recover , said Ramlan . 
they will take time to heal . 
the resignation of Malaysia &apos;s Selangor state chief minister on Saturday added to the market &apos;s angst , analysts and dealers said . 
the state &apos;s investment arm controls several small-capitalised listed companies , said the head of research at a local brokerage house . 
market volume stood at 269 million shares , valued at 2.01 billion ringgit . 
losers trounced gainers 711 to 21 . 
&quot; No volume is a good sign , &quot; said Ang Kok Heng , general manager of T.A. 
asset Management . 
&quot; I think the market is coming to a bottom , but it &apos;s hard to say if a sharp technical rebound will come in . 
if the Dow stabilises , but doesn &apos;t rebound , I think the market will be sideways . 
at the close on the Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial futures Exchange , the spot April contract shed 30 points to settle at 1,102.0 with 608 lots traded . 
the May futures contract slipped 27.7 to 1,101.5 with six lots changing hands .
