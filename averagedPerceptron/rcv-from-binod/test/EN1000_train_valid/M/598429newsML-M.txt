1705 GMT - Portuguese shares recovered from the lows of the session at the close in low turnover of 5.3 billion escudos , as the market discounted a possible rise in U.S. short term rates at the FOMC meeting later today . 
the most active shares included Banco Comercial Portugues , Portucel , Cimpor and Portugal Telecom . 
dealers said the trend of the market tomorrow would depend on the decision of the FOMC today . 
&quot; As the markets have already discounted a rise in U.S. rates , if the Fed leaves them unchanged , the main markets will draw breath and rise again , &quot; a dealer said . 
&quot; But even if the Fed raises rates by 25 basis points , conditions are in place for some stocks to strengthen .
