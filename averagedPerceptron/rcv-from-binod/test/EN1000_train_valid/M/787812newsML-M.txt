China &apos;s yuan currency maintained its relentless climb against the U.S. dollar on Friday , closing at a 26-month high with further room to rise due to China &apos;s healthy trade surplus , dealers and analysts said . 
the yuan closed at 8.2894 to the dollar , its highest close since May 18 , 1995 , when the local unit ended at 8.2892 . 
ample supply of the U.S. currency in the market foreshadowed further rises for the yuan , although the central bank was expected to continue to intervene to prevent sharp gains and to keep the rate relatively stable , dealers said . 
&quot; The strength of the yuan will continue for quite a while because of the trade surplus and inflows of foreign capital , &quot; said a dealer at the national China Foreign Exchange Trading System , which is based in Shanghai . 
&quot; The fundamentals have been the same all along , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There is greater supply than demand for the U.S. 
dollar . 
China &apos;s foreign trade surplus hit $ 17.77 billion in the first half of this year , against $ 876 million for the same period in 1996 , official figures showed . 
actual foreign investment in China was about $ 20.72 billion in the first half of 1997 , the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation has said . 
dealers said the yuan was likely to continue to gain at a measured pace against the dollar in the longer term , reaching 8.20 yuan in 1998 , but would probably end this year at around the 8.29 level . 
&quot; The central bank has been trying to make the yuan appreciate very slowly , but they can &apos;t stop the rise , &quot; the dealer said . 
the People &apos;s Bank of China , the central bank , has mopped up U.S. dollars by buying excess supply in the market , dealers said . 
U.S.-dollar buying by the central bank has helped China &apos;s foreign exchange reserves to swell to $ 121 billion at the end of June , up from $ 105 billion at the end of 1996 , they said . 
the central bank fears a strong local currency would make China &apos;s exports less competitive overseas and it also aims to keep the yuan relatively stable before a major Communist Party congress in September or October , analysts said . 
&quot; The government wants to see a very stable yuan because they &apos;re going to have a party congress , and Beijing is also watching the currency turmoil in southeast Asia , &quot; said Ken Chan , an economist for Nikko Research Centre in Hong Kong . 
political and economic stability is a key theme before any major government meeting , analysts said . 
wobbling currencies in several southeast Asian countries -- including Thailand , Malaysia and Indonesia -- have convinced China that a stable yuan coupled with high foreign exchange reserves to protect the currency is the correct policy for now , they said . 
&quot; The central bank policy has been to intervene to keep the yuan stable , &quot; said Jason Kwok , chief economist for Citibank N.A. 
in Hong Kong . 
but he warned that continued intervention , which involves selling yuan to buy U.S. dollars , could be inflationary since such moves pump more liquidity into the market . 
&quot; There is a limit to what they can do in terms of this intervention policy , &quot; he said , adding that the government may have to readdress that policy at some time in the future .
