LME copper prices pushed higher within their recent range on Monday morning , getting help from flaring spreads , but many traders were cautious about the future outlook . 
cash for a day was bid up to a $ 20 backwardation as the first of the tight dates , January 29 , came into play . 
the LME has imposed limit on that spread of one percent of cash , which on Monday was about $ 26 . 
the backwardation of cash / three months widened slightly to $ 305 / $ 315 , while cash / week was bid up to a $ 95 backwardation . 
there was interest in Feb / threes at $ 85 backwardation with talk circulating that this was due to a player covering February options postions . 
three months activity was sluggish , with players wary about the market &apos;s future direction . 
the big question was whether shorts would cover or roll over and thereby how much the spreads would lose steam as the tight dates become prompt . 
&quot; I &apos;m just standing back , it could go either way , &quot; one floor trader said . 
another believed positions would be rolled over and the market remain tight unless the robust backwardations attract too much metal into LME warehouses . 
three months ended the morning kerb $ 18 firmer at $ 2,261 per tonne while cash finished at $ 2,573 , a fresh high since the November 28 peak of $ 2,580 . 
aluminium three months probed above key $ 1,640 resistance on trade buying but speculative selling took the froth off the market , finishing the morning at $ 1,638 , up $ 2 . 
spreads were also active on aluminium , with the cash / threes backwardation holding its narrower stance at $ 17 / $ 20 while March / June was at a $ 1 / $ 4 backwardation . 
April 9 / day was at a $ 3 backwardation . 
the other metals remained in the background , gravitating within narrow ranges . 
zinc stayed in a $ 6 price band with the floor at $ 1,140 , ending the day $ 3 stronger at $ 1,142 . 
lead added $ 1 to $ 700 and nickel finished the kerb unchanged at $ 7,300 . 
tin was slightly weaker at $ 5,990 / $ 6,000 versus $ 6,020 while alloy ended $ 3 firmer at $ 1,535 / 38 .
