most Bucharest share prices posted gains on Thursday but trading , dominated by retail investors , was modest in volume , brokers said . 
overall turnover dropped by almost 30 million lei to 68.5 million , with the total number of shares traded slipping to 12,575 from 14,075 . 
seven stocks rose , four fell , one was flat and one had no trade . 
&quot; Prices extended recent gains on the back of half-year reports which for most stocks are healthy , &quot; a trader said . 
buying activity focused on state fertiliser maker Azomures SA -- which had 26.9 million lei in turnover -- and on Artrom SA state engineering company -- which accounted for 22 percent of overall turnover . 
&quot; Azomures touched a high 13,100 lei in early trading in a deal involving a larger share package but with no interest at that price its quote dropped afterwards , &quot; one trader said . 
Azomures ended at 12,100 lei , 200 lei down from Tuesday &apos;s close . 
Artrom also fell , closing 100 lei weaker at 2,550 . 
the session &apos;s biggest gainer was syringe maker Sanevit SA SNVT.BX , the exchange &apos;s sole private company , which gained 1,700 lei closing at 14,200 . 
the Bursa de Valori Bucuresti said on Thursday it was cutting pre-market trading to half an hour from two hours starting next Tuesday , extending the continuous trading session by an hour and a half to three and a half hours . 
brokers welcomed the move saying it meant more time for deals . 
the unofficial VAB Index -- a value-weighted index of all stocks computed by vanguard SA securities -- was 2.3 percent up from the previous session , closing at 371 points . 
its base was 1,000 points when it was created last November .
