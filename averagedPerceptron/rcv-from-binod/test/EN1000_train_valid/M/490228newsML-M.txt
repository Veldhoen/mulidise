world oil prices drew breath on Monday after plunging nearly nine percent last week to nine month lows . 
dealers said further losses were likely in the short term as global oil supplies grow strongly . 
London futures for benchmark North Sea Brent blend crude ended up 10 cents at $ 17.78 a barrel for May , barely denting last week &apos;s $ 1.70 slide and dwarfed by losses of $ 6.50 so far this year . 
&quot; Something fairly spectacular has to take place to dramatically improve crude fundamentals . 
there is still too much supply around , &quot; said brokers GNI in a report . 
cheap crude oil has encouraged refiners to process more oil ahead of the peak summer gasoline season , taking advantage of profit margins which have not been seen for nearly a year . 
but industry sources say the boot remains firmly on the buyers &apos; foot , partly because of ample supply from the Organisation of Petroleum exporting Countries ( OPEC ) . 
&quot; It seems to me that OPEC ( members ) are sticking to the extra production they enjoyed due to very firm prices last year despite the fact that the market has become one of surplus rather than shortage , &quot; said the head of crude trading for a major North Sea producer . 
OPEC &apos;s 11 producers lifted output by 130,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) to 26.90 million bpd in March , almost 1.9 million bpd above their official ceiling . 
this has played a large part in driving prices down to nine-month lows and destroying any hopes that they might have harboured of a repeat of last year &apos;s windfall revenues , analysts said . 
Iraqi exports under a United Nations oil-for-food deal , due for renewal in June shortly before the cartel &apos;s regular ministerial meeting in Vienna , may rise in May as falling benchmark prices force Baghdad to ship greater volumes to meet its $ 1 billion target . 
&quot; The lower the price goes , the more Iraq can pump , creating a vicious circle which OPEC will have to tackle at its June meeting if it doesn &apos;t want to see even weaker prices , &quot; said the senior North Sea trader . 
but with most OPEC members apparently consigning quota compliance to the dustbin and non-OPEC output continuing to grow at a rapid rate , industry sources expect even weaker prices , at least for the near future . 
in the longer term rising Asian demand could stem the slide , some analysts say , pointing to forward crude derivatives which are pricing Brent around current levels for the next two years . 
&quot; Clearly there is a battle between OPEC output , which is a mixture of cheating and Iraq , and the demand driver out of the Far East , &quot; said Paul Spedding , oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson . 
&quot; The OPEC hare is winning the race at the moment but the super-charged Far East tortoise is catching up fast , &quot; he said . 
last month , the Japanese Trade Ministry said Asian demand for oil products should outpace the region &apos;s refining capacity by the year 2000 , with annual growth reaching at least 5.1 percent , more than double the global forecast .
