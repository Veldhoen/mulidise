U.S. stock index futures ended lower across the board , although Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s 500 contracts recovered late in the day on short-covering by hedge funds , traders said . 
they said hedge funds were short at the start of the session due to arbitrage sell programs , and became entrenched with short positions during the market &apos;s rapid-fire sell-off in the afternoon . 
those hedge funds rushed to cover positions before the market closed . 
as a result , March S &amp; Ps bounced 3.00 points in the final minutes of the session . 
traders linked declines to the U.S. bond market , which continued to grind lower ahead of Friday &apos;s employment data . 
&quot; We are trying to discount a strong payroll number , &quot; said Kurt Schultz , reseach director at Refco Inc . &quot; That is the gist of it . 
traders , on average , are forecasting that December nonfarm payrolls will rise 192,000 , after November &apos;s gain of 118,000 . 
they are looking for unemployment to fall to 5.3 percent from 5.3 percent in November . 
average hourly earnings for December are estimated to rise 0.2 percent , from up 0.8 percent in November . 
&quot; If the nonfarm payrolls number does not rise more than 200,000 , this thing will be right back up , &quot; Schultz said . 
Schultz said the market used jitters about a meeting this morning between President Clinton and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan as an excuse to sell . 
one major U.S. firm forecast a rate hike , which also weakened sentiment and helped push prices lower . 
traders are looking at 738.00 and 727.00 as major support levels in March S &amp; Ps . 
March S &amp; Ps still held a wide premium to cash S &amp; Ps , with the contract closing more than 7.00 points above cash . 
fair value is currently at 5.35 points . 
traders said March &apos;s wide premium at the opening led to waves of both arbitrage buy and sell programs this morning . 
arbitrage buy programs were seen at about 6.25 points over cash , while sell programs were noted roughly around a premium of 4.45 points . 
meanwhile , Nikkei futures closed sharply lower after a second day of sharp declines . 
March Nikkeis set a contract low of 18,670 . 
at the close of pit trade , March S &amp; Ps were down 4.15 at 755.50 , KCBT Value Lines were 4.15 lower at 690.00 , New composites were down 2.05 points at 398.00 , Nikkeis fell 225.0 at 18,710 , Midcap 400s edged down 0.95 to 260.15 and Nasdaq 100s were off 11.35 points at 862.75 .
