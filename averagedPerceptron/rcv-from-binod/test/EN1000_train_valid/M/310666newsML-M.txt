gold looks set to tumble and possibly breach the all important support level of $ 350.00 an ounce during European trading on Wednesday following a mauling from investment funds in New York overnight , traders said . 
in early London trading spot gold was around its lowest level since October 1993 at $ 353.00 , well down on Tuesday &apos;s London close of $ 357.30 / $ 357.80 . 
&quot; We may see a minor bounce , but overall the market is firmly locked in a downside move ... most people are looking to sell , while few are willing to buy , &quot; a trader said . 
overhanging the market was Monday &apos;s news that the Dutch central bank had sold 300 tonnes of gold , analysts said . 
they remained wary of further sales by central banks and speculative liquidation . 
a strong dollar and a modest increase in December U.S. inflation data on Tuesday were also helping to dent sentiment . 
if gold broke below $ 350.00 there was little in the way of support until $ 345.00 , traders said . 
&quot; A break below the all-important $ 350.00 level is likely to trigger fresh waves of selling , &quot; one trader said .
