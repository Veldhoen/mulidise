former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone on Tuesday praised Peru &apos;s firm stand against the rebels holding 74 hostages in Lima . 
at a news conference , he also said he would seek a resolution of support for the Peruvian government from Asian parliamentarians meeting in Vancouver . 
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori &quot; no compromise &quot; policy in the crisis &quot; should be fully supported and respected ... , &quot; Nakasone said . 
&quot; I admire the very decisive and firm attitude on the part of President Fujimori , &quot; Nakasone said before a four-day meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum , which groups legislators from 25 Pacific Rim countries . 
the group previously passed a resolution urging governments &quot; not to concede to terrorists &apos; demands , &quot; Nakasone said . 
&quot; I think we should fully support the Peruvian government based on that principle . 
Nakasone , chairman of the group , said he hoped that the forum would decide this week to send an expression of support to Peru . 
current Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has said that Tokyo wants a peaceful outcome to the crisis and has expressed fears of bloodshed if an attempt is made to rescue the hostages still held by Marxist rebels who stormed the Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence in Lima three weeks ago .
