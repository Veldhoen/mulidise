Tommy Lasorda , Nellie Fox and negro League star Willie Wells were elected to the baseball Hall of fame on Wednesday by the Veterans Committee . 
the Veterans Committee , a 15-man panel of former players , executives and media members , voted in the colourful former manager of the dodgers , the gritty Chicago White SOx second baseman and shortstop Wells during its annual meeting . 
the 69-year-old Lasorda , who stepped down as manager of the dodgers due to health reasons last year , compiled a 1599-1439 record in 20 seasons and led Los Angeles to four National League pennants and two World Series titles . 
&quot; Tommy is a baseball fixture , &quot; said veteran dodger centre fielder Brett Butler . 
&quot; It is an honour to have played for him . 
Lasorda , who managed the dodgers for 23 years , is one of only four managers in major league history to guide one team for 20 or more seasons , trailing only Connie Mack ( 50 seasons with the Philadelphia Athletics team he owned ) , John McGraw ( 31 seasons with the New York giants ) , and his dodgers predecessor Walter Alston . 
&quot; He &apos;s one of the greatest managers ever to wear a uniform , &quot; said dodgers first baseman Eric Karros . 
Lasorda , whose 61 post-season games managed ranks second to former New York Yankee manager Casey Stengel by two , is 13th on the all-time wins list for managers . 
Fox , a standout second baseman who also played for the Philadelphia Athletics and Houston , was named to 10 All-Star teams and totalled 2,663 hits in a 19-year career that ended in 1965 . 
he was named on the necessary 75 percent of the ballots cast by the Veterans Committee last year , but was denied election by the rule that restricts the committee from electing more than one person from the former player category each year . 
Jim Bunning won election through the Veterans Committee by being named on 12 of the 14 ballots . 
Fox was named on 11 . 
it was the second time Fox narrowly missed election to the Hall of fame . 
in 1985 , in his 15th and final year on the regular ballot and 10 years after his death , Fox received 295 votes when 297 were needed for election . 
wells , who died in 1989 , played 20 seasons in the negro leagues with a slew of different teams . 
wells , who enjoyed his best seasons with the St Louis Stars in the 1920s , finished his career with a .328 batting average and 126 homers . 
eighteen other major leaguers were considered , including Pete Browning , Bill Dahlen , George Davis , Dom DiMaggio , Larry Doby , Wes Ferrell , Jack Glasscock , Joe Gordon , Gil Hodges , Marty Marion , Carl mays , Bill Mazeroski , Bid McPhee , Allie Reynolds , Jimmy Ryan , Harry Stovey and George Van Haltren . 
the Veterans Committee includes former players Yogi Berra , Monte Irvin , Stan Musial , Pee Wee Reese and Ted Williams ; former executives Joe Brown , Buzzie Bavasi , buck O &apos;Neil , Hank Peters and Bill White ; and media members Bob Broeg , Ken Coleman , Leonard Koppett , Allen Lewis and Jerome Holtzman .
