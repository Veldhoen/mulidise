mission control on Saturday was closely monitoring a troublesome power generator aboard the space shuttle Columbia that could cut short its 16-day science mission , a NASA official said . 
the performance of the electricity-generating fuel cell had degraded since the shuttle blasted off on Friday , Jeff Bantle of NASA &apos;s mission operations told a news conference . 
&quot; We take fuel cell performance very seriously , &quot; he said . 
if the device , one of three aboard Columbia , continues to deteriorate , the astronauts would be forced to shut it down to avoid a potential fire or explosion . 
NASA &apos;s safety rules require an early end to the mission if the device is switched off , Bantle said . 
Columbia could return to Earth as early as Monday afternoon . 
the shuttle can land safely with two working fuel cells , and could probably limp home on one . 
the devices , which are located in the shuttle &apos;s fuselage , provide all of the shuttle &apos;s electrical power . 
they combine supercold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to generate electricty and , as a byproduct , drinking water . 
the fuel cell had briefly exhibited unusual voltage readings during the final hours of the countdown early on Friday . 
Bantle was hopeful the device would stablize and allow the 16-day mission to go ahead as planned . 
&quot; Right now the degradation is very slow , so we do have a fair amount of time to monitor it and understand the phenomenon , &quot; he said . 
the devices have performed near flawlessly since then . 
Columbia &apos;s seven astronauts were to spend 16 days in space working on 33 major experiments . 
they will light dozens of controlled fires to study the behaviour of flames in space and grow protein crystals that NASA hopes will help the fight against cancer , diabetes , AIDS and other ailments . 
the astronauts were also trying to fix a computer glitch affecting one of the two fire experiments .
