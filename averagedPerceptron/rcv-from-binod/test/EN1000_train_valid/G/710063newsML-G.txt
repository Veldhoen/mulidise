a supply ship docked with Russia &apos;s Mir space station on Monday , delivering equipment crucial for the future of the troubled 11-year mission . 
&quot; Contact , &quot; a mission control official said amid applause in the control centre at Korolyov near Moscow , where senior government and space industry officials were present for the tricky docking . 
officials said the fully automatic docking operation finished successfully after six minutes from the first contact . 
&quot; All electric connections between Mir and Progress have been made . 
tightening of the connection has been carried out , &quot; the official said , adding that this was the final stage of the docking operation . 
officials said the sprawling space station was directly over the Volga river in Russia on its orbit round the Earth when the docking took place . 
&quot; Don &apos;t do anything before the next radio contact , &quot; Vladimir Solovyov , the flight director , told Mir crew during a radio contact which continued through all phases of the docking . 
the next contact was due within an hour &apos;s time . 
officials said three docking attempts had been envisaged in the case of problems . 
the predecessor of the unmanned Progress craft launched on Saturday crashed into the station during docking on June 25 in the worst accident in the station &apos;s history . 
Mir lost up to half its electric power in the collision and experts had said this could hamper Monday &apos;s docking . 
the latest Progress craft is carrying oxygen , food and water as well as the tools needed to save the station . 
there are also parcels from the families of the three-man Russian-U.S. crew , who have had a nerve-wracking and uncomfortable time since the accident .
