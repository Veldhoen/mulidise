four sets of skeletal remains have been recovered from the site in North Korea of a fierce 1950 Korean War battle and are now in U.S. possession , the Defence Department said on Friday . 
the remains brought the number recovered from that conflict to just five , out of more than 8,100 U.S. military personnel unaccounted for , said Alan Liotta , deputy director of the Defence Prisoner of War / Missing Personnel office . 
a U.S. team worked for 20 days in rural North Korea to recover remains as U.S. , North Korean , South Korean and Chinese diplomats in New York held talks on proposed negotiations for a durable peace agreement to end the 1950-53 Korean conflict formally . 
two more such missions are planned for later this month and October , Liotta said . 
&quot; I believe that much of the success ( of the recovery operation ) comes from the fact that we &apos;ve been very careful to delineate this issue as a humanitarian issue , separate from any other issue , and one that &apos;s really a soldier-to-soldier issue , &quot; Liotta said at a briefing . 
the teams have been combing an agricultural area in Unsan County , 50 miles ( 80 km ) southwest of the Yalu River , where U.S. troops clashed with Chinese communist forces in October and November of 1950 , Liotta said . 
the four sets of remains just recovered are believed to be from the First Battalion of the Army &apos;s 8th Cavalry . 
another man &apos;s remains were recovered in the same area in 1996 . 
U.S. records indicate that about 350 U.S. soldiers were killed in the area , and Liotta said he could not speculate about how many sets of remains would be recovered . 
in addition to the battlefield excavation , U.S. officials were permitted to do research in North Korean military records and war museums for clues about the missing men . 
&quot; My understanding is that the North Koreans have shared a great amount of information with the team , including unit histories , anti-aircraft shoot-down logs , some personal war records , &quot; Liotta said . 
he said the North Koreans were &quot; leery &quot; of what the United States might do with the information , adding : &quot; Their particular concern is that we &apos;re going to use it for some political purpose to criticise them . 
however , Liotta said there were &quot; significantly reduced tensions &quot; between the two countries &apos; teams , compared with a similar mission last year which began &quot; basically under gunpoint . 
the North Koreans provided helicopter support for the remote site , let the U.S. experts communicate by radio with U.S. officials in Pyongyang and agreed to reposition an antenna so the radios would work better , Liotta said . 
a recently de-classified U.S. Air Force report said at least five and possibly dozens of missing U.S. airmen were alive and in Chinese or North Korean hands at the end of the war . 
asked about the report , Liotta said all reports would be treated seriously but declined to speculate on whether any of the men might be alive . 
but he noted that six U.S. military personnel were believed to have defected to North Korea between the 1960s and 1980s , and said four of these were thought to be alive and working as advisers to Pyongyang &apos;s military . 
asked whether North Korea &apos;s famine had had any visible impact , Liotta said team members found conditions deteriorated as they got farther from Pyongyang . 
about 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help defend the country . 
the demilitarized zone that divides North and South is one of the last vestiges of the Cold War . 
in New York , the four-nation talks on proposed peace negotiations stalled over North Korean demands that the U.S. withdraw its troops from the South and sign a separate treaty with Pyongyang , officials said on Thursday .
