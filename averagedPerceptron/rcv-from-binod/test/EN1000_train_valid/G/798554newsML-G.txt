then he amused yesterday &apos;s All Black media conference , saying he was only nine years old then . 
&quot; When did you switch to prop ? 
&quot; he was asked . 
one who is normally too shy to oblige to interviews , Brown broke a self-imposed rule to front up yesterday for his third appearance before the media this year . 
he usually restricts himself to just one appearance a year . 
such silence can be deceiving , as his opponents on the domestic and international scenes have found over the years . 
Brown prefers to let his action speak . 
it &apos;s probably why he &apos;s still the most feared All Black on the field though that aura has been broken down by the constant Super 12 and test rugby contacts with the Australians and the South Africans . 
on Saturday the 29-year-old tighthead prop -- the best in the business -- sets two milestones . 
he will make his 200th first-class appearance and set the All Black record for most appearances in the front row as a combination with Craig Dowd and captain Sean Fitzpatrick . 
fronting up for their 34th test , at Carisbrook against the Wallabies , the trio will then be just three internationals away from equalling the world record for most appearances by a front row combination . 
this front row is the cornerstone of the All Blacks &apos; success . 
the game may have changed dramatically over the recent years but it is still won or lost from the front . 
&quot; I think in the modern day game it &apos;s going to be a real weapon against any opposition . 
if you don &apos;t get your frontfoot dominance , if you don &apos;t get your good scrummaging -- these guys are more than scrummagers -- you don &apos;t get the start , &quot; All Black coach John Hart said yesterday . 
the long term success of any rugby team , Auckland , the blues and the All Blacks being prime examples , depend on the front rowers . 
in this case the front three happen to be the same for all three teams . 
it may not be where the game is most exciting , it &apos;s not where you &apos;ll see breath-taking skills and pace nor the smiles if there are any in the game . 
it &apos;s the firing line where the uncompromising power-play , subtle techniques and mind games are fiercely contested . 
the intensity is such that the complexion of the game is entirely dependent on it . 
these are the men who do the back-breaking spadework , dig and forage for the ball where it &apos;s almost unreachable and provide the support to ensure it pops out in good time and space for flashy backs like Carlos Spencer , Christian Cullen and Jeff 
Wilson . 
rugby fans normally judge the game through the excitements -- the running and passing game and the thrills of the tries . 
the purists analyse the match from the front , from the front row to the back row and the pack as a whole . 
all the Auckland , blues and All Black successes have come from the shoulders of Brown , Dowd and Fitzpatrick , not the biggest nor heaviest of the front rows but the soundest and technically the best in world rugby . 
the trio have added a new dimension to scrummaging with their ball skills , mobility and athleticism . 
&quot; You would have seen at Melbourne ( MCG ) the tremendous contribution from the three in terms of taking the ball up and their ball skills , &quot; Hart said of the All Blacks victory over the Wallabies there . 
&quot; I think the difference that this front row brings to any other front row is the fact that they are not only excellent scrummagers , but they are very good ball-skill players . 
their all-round contribution to the side is very , very important . 
&quot; A coach or a selection panel like ours is very fortunate to base a team of front row on such experience and such ability . 
&quot; They contribute to the speed , mobility and athleticism of the All Black forward pack . 
Brown played league mostly until he was about 17 . 
his first call by the All Blacks came way back in 1990 when the injury-stricken team touring France needed backup and Brown was flown to Paris from Canada where he was touring with a development side . 
it was not until 1992 that Brown made his test debut , against Ireland , and he hasn &apos;t looked back since . 
the 1.85m and 110kg prop plays his 58th match for the All Blacks and his 46th test on Saturday . 
Fitzpatrick , the master of front row play and in for his 91st test appearance , said of the All Black front row : &quot; Of the three I think Craig has really developed over the last year . 
&quot; It &apos;s been really important in terms of combinations , it &apos;s probably one of the things the South Africans and the Australians are finding difficult at the moment -- they &apos;re not playing together enough to develop a combination . 
&quot; I notice the difference straight away when I &apos;m not playing with either Craig or with Olo -- the difference is we just know what each other is going to do . 
it &apos;s really important to the team if we can create a stable base for the rest of the team to 
develop their game . 
Brown paid tribute to Fitzpatrick , 34 , saying : &quot; He &apos;s as hard on himself as he is to the others . 
these days , however , Dowd , 27 , has started setting the standards for the front row . 
&quot; He &apos;s the outspoken one , he &apos;s the critical one now . 
if things are not going right Dowdy will tell you so , &quot; said Brown .
