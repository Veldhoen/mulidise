Chad Ogea outpitched previously undefeated Jimmy Key and David Justice and Manny Ramirez each had three hits as the Cleveland Indians won their sixth straight , 6-1 over the Baltimore Orioles Friday . 
Ogea ( 5-3 ) gave up an unearned run and two hits with a pair of walks and a career-high nine strikeouts . 
Strikeouts can be overrated . 
it was his first career two-hitter and bettered his previous low-hit game , a three-hitter against Seattle on July 6 , 1995 . 
&quot; There are some nights when you go out there and everything you throw is where you want it to go , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It doesn &apos;t happen very often . 
Ogea , who set down the final 14 batters in order , improved to 4-1 in his career against the Orioles and won his third straight start . 
&quot; That may be one of the best games I &apos;ve seen pitched in a long , long , long time and it came against a good hitting team , &quot; said Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove . 
key ( 8-1 ) watched his ERA rocket more than a half-run to 2.38 as he failed to become the first major leaguer to nine wins . 
he was ripped for six runs and 10 hits with two walks and no strikeouts in 4 1 / 3 innings . 
in his first-ever start at Jacobs Field , Key had his shortest outing of the season and the most hits and runs he has allowed . 
key had not lost since last September when he was with the Yankees . 
in New York , pinch-hitter Mike Stanley burned his former team with a three-run Homer for the second straight game as the Boston Red SOx pounded the Yankees 9-3 . 
Stanley , who left the Yankees last year to sign as a free agent with Boston , hit a three-run Homer in Thursday &apos;s 8-2 victory . 
he snapped a 3-3 tie with an opposite-field blast in the eighth as the Red SOx sent New York to its fifth straight loss , tying a season high . 
Wil Cordero , coming off Thursday &apos;s career-high five-hit game , added a three-run shot in the ninth . 
he is 7-for-10 in the first two games of the four-game set . 
in Kansas City , Paul Sorrento , Jay Buhner and Ken Griffey homered as the Seattle mariners overcame an early four-run deficit to hand the Royals their season-high seventh straight defeat , 8-4 . 
Randy Johnson ( 6-1 ) gave up four runs and eight hits in seven innings . 
Johnson , after a shaky first three innings , finished with three walks and 10 strikeouts , the 72nd time in his career he has reached double digits . 
Buhner has homered in four straight games . 
Griffey , with a major-league leading 21 homers , is one home run short of matching his 1994 major-league record for homers by the end of May . 
when Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961 , he did not get his 20th Homer until June 11 . 
Babe Ruth also hit his 20th Homer in his 60-home run season on June 11 . 
in Chicago , Scott Karl allowed just one run over eight innings and Mark Loretta and Gerald Williams homered as the Milwaukee Brewers snapped the White SOx &apos;s six-game winning streak with a 4-1 victory . 
Karl ( 2-5 ) allowed only three singles with a walk and five strikeouts in his longest outing of the season . 
after giving up two hits in the first , the left-hander retired 22 of the last 23 batters he faced . 
Karl is 2-0 in his last three starts after losing his first five decisions . 
Doug Jones pitched the ninth for his 11th save . 
the 253rd save of his career moved him past Dave Righetti into 10th place all-time . 
in Detroit , Brian Moehler allowed one run and recorded a career-high nine strikeouts in eight innings and Tony Clark added three hits , including his 17th Homer , as the Tigers stopped the Texas Rangers 7-1 . 
Clark &apos;s Homer tied him with New York &apos;s Tino Martinez for second in the American League in homers , behind Griffey . 
the Tigers ( 20-25 ) did not pick up their 20th win last year until June 22 in their 74th game . 
after allowing a two-out Homer to rusty Greer in the first , Moehler ( 3-3 ) settled down and gave up seven hits and a walk over the next seven innings . 
in Toronto , Tim Salmon had four hits and drove in three runs and Gary DiSarcina added a three-run Homer as the surging Anaheim angels pounded out 17 hits and routed the Blue Jays 12-2 . 
Dennis Springer ( 3-1 ) allowed two runs and seven hits in his first complete game of the season . 
he won his third straight game . 
in his last 21 1 / 3 innings , the knuckleballer has allowed five runs and 14 hits . 
the win was the angels &apos; 10th in 11 games . 
at Minnesota , Steve Karsay allowed three runs over 7 2 / 3 innings and Jason Giambi doubled and drove in three runs as the Oakland Athletics posted an 8-4 victory over the twins . 
Karsay ( 1-5 ) gave up six hits , walked two and struck out six to register his first win since April 9 1994 . 
the right-hander , who missed all of 1995 due to injury , registered his longest outing of the season .
