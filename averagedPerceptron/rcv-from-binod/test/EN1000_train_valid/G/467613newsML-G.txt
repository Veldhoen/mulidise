Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan on Tuesday survived a parliamentary motion calling on him to stand aside , but army-backed protesters kept up the pressure over a mercenary fiasco . 
after a week of setbacks for Chan , parliament voted 58 to 39 against a motion which urged Chan and two close aides to step down while an inquiry was held into the contract for mercenaries to put down an island uprising . 
Chan himself took the floor only once in a rowdy five-hour debate , saying he had hired almost 70 African mercenaries to prevent more PNG soldiers dying on the island of Bougainville . 
&quot; Sometimes you have to make decisions in the best interests of the security of the nation and we made this decision and will not compromise that decision , &quot; Chan said . 
&quot; I had to put the lives of our soldiers on Bougainville first . 
the PNG crisis began last Monday when army chief Jerry Singirok demanded that the mercenary contract be terminated and that Chan , Deputy Prime Minister Chris Haiveta and Defence Minister Mathias Ijape resign . 
Singirok was promptly sacked but remains in control of the army . 
his sacking led to violent street protests which saw former colonial power Australia put troops on standby to evacuate around 10,000 Australian nationals . 
Singirok on Friday repeated a demand that Chan quit and set a deadline of Tuesday , but that deadline apparently passed without any action from the army . 
about five minutes after Tuesday &apos;s vote , MPs were warned to stay inside the building for security reasons because cars leaving parliament were being stoned . 
it turned out to be only a minor incident at the back entrance . 
on the other side of the building , however , around 1,000 noisy protesters remained , joined shortly after the vote by a group of about 12 armed soldiers who sat peacefully on the ground . 
protest leaders said they intended to ignore a 10 p.m. curfew and stay outside parliament overnight . 
the motion was introduced to parliament by opposition leader Bill skate , who is governor of the capital Port Moresby . 
skate told parliament that the South Pacific nation was divided and its international credibility was in tatters because Chan agreed the $ 36 million contract with British-based mercenary firm Sandline without consulting cabinet . 
&quot; Our nation has been torn apart with division and more and more questions about corruption in high office , &quot; skate told parliament as MPs from both sides shouted each other down . 
&quot; We have the crisis today because of one man &apos;s ego -- it is madness , madness . 
defence Minister Ijape said the Sandline contract made financial and military sense : PNG spent 120 million Kina ( $ 86 million ) a year fighting on Bougainville and had spent a total of 1.2 billion Kina since 1989 ; 200 soldiers had died , as well as 50 policemen and thousands of Bougainvilleans . 
and Ijape blamed Australia and New Zealand for refusing to supply the PNG defence force with helicopter gunships and other military hardware it needed to beat the Bougainville rebels . 
he said both the PNG defence force and the rebels had the same low-level weaponry , making the war unwinnable . 
&quot; We were not in a position of strength . 
they know our weaknesses and every time we call for these peace meetings they take it as a joke , &quot; Ijape said . 
&quot; Bougainville is the biggest sickness that has ever been brought to this country . 
it &apos;s like an ulcer , &quot; he added . 
( Kina = $ 0.72 )
