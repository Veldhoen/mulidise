a leading Russian newspaper on Tuesday questioned the Kremlin &apos;s haste in promoting without public debate a treaty creating a union with neighbouring Belarus , reflecting liberal concerns about the pact . 
&quot; They are deciding the fate of Russia behind the backs of the people , &quot; liberal daily Izvestia said in the lead headline of its Tuesday editions . 
&quot; Was it agreement or conspiracy prepared in the corridors of power ? 
under the treaty , expected to be signed on Wednesday , the two ex-Soviet states would remain independent but coordinate their foreign , economic and military policies closely . 
an updated draft of the treaty obtained by Reuters on Monday night was confusing and left many questions unanswered . 
President Boris Yeltsin gave the green light to the treaty on Monday , and was expected to sign it on April 3 with his Belarus counterpart Alexander Lukashenko , Russian media reported . 
Russia , a nuclear state of nearly 150 million people , has been working on forming a &quot; community &quot; with its less wealthy western neighbour of about 10 million under a deal signed by the two leaders on April 2 last year . 
&quot; There will be a union of two states rather then a single state , &quot; Valery Serov , Russia &apos;s deputy prime minister who co-authored the treaty , told a news conference . 
the potential transformation of Russia was rushed so quickly that even Yeltsin &apos;s allies complained about the lack of debate . 
&quot; The government &apos;s mistake is that it has rather quickly and secretly worked out the agreement and presented it for ratification , &quot; Sergei Belyayev , a leader of the pro-government Russia &apos;s Choice fraction of parliament , told NTV commercial television . 
&quot; That &apos;s why there emerged more questions than answers . 
even Serov &apos;s remarks suggested that Russians were confused about the most basic issues related to the treaty . 
&quot; Some people are asking : &apos; In what country will we wake up on April 3 ? 
&apos; , &quot; Serov said . 
&quot; The answer is : in the very same country you went to bed . 
Russia &apos;s embrace of Belarus comes at a time of increasing international isolation for Minsk . 
in recent weeks Belarus has cracked down on political dissent , and last week ordered the expulsion of a U.S. diplomat . 
it has also tried to limit foreign television reporting . 
some Russian liberals said they fear the authoritarian Lukashenko , who has lagged far behind Moscow in economic reform , could gain a slice of power at the Kremlin &apos;s expense , posing questions about democracy , stability and human rights . 
above all , liberals fear Lukashenko could gain jurisdiction over some decisions affecting Russia under a nine-member Supreme Council which will oversee the Russia-Belarus union . 
however , previous accords on integration have had few practical implications . 
the latest plans are ambitious , speaking of a union with a joint legal system , joint running of energy , transport and communications systems and a common customs policy . 
it would also prepare for introducing a single currency . 
Yeltsin , 66 , believes forging better ties with Belarus is a sure political winner since many Russians are nostalgic for the Soviet Union which fell apart in 1991 . 
it could also deflect some attention from Russia &apos;s economic woes . 
but Kremlin sources said Russian officials haggled over the draft in last-minute talks late on Monday . 
they said liberals , led by first deputy prime ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov , had tried to prevent Yeltsin &apos;s approval of the treaty and that divisions had opened in the government . 
&quot; If the document needs corrections or more work , it &apos;s better to do it without hurrying it , so that mistakes are not made , &quot; Nemtsov told NTV on Monday night .
