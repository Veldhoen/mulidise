Sweden and Borussia Moenchengladbach striker Martin Dahlin is considering an offer to join Ajax , the Swedish daily Expressen reported on Friday . 
&quot; I have had a serious request from Ajax and it seems interesting . 
( Ajax manager ) Morten Olsen has said he wants to buy me , &quot; the 29-year-old Dahlin told the daily . 
Dahlin , a mercurial striker who combines flashes of genius with periods of ineffectiveness , has said he wants to leave the German club at the end of this season . 
&quot; I &apos;ve told the club I won &apos;t be carrying on at Moenchengladbach ... Italy is attractive but Ajax is also a good alternative .
