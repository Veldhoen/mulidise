England seized the initiative in their four-day tour match against a New Zealand Selection XI on Monday but captain Mike Atherton failed to improve his nightmare form with the bat . 
England dismissed the Selection XI for 138 , with only opener Craig Spearman coming close to mastering the bowling attack in his innings of 41 . 
All-rounder Craig White captured four for 15 from 9.4 overs of hostile fast-medium bowling , while Dominic Cork and Chris Silverwood chipped in with two wickets apiece . 
England also fielded smartly , with Atherton taking a fine one-handed reflex catch in the gully to dismiss New Zealand test batsman Adam Parore for a duck . 
but the England skipper &apos;s run drought on tour in Zimbabwe and New Zealand continued when he fell lbw to fast-medium Bowler Robert Kennedy for seven . 
England were 106 for three at stumps , with veteran test Bowler Danny Morrison dismissing opener Nick Knight for 46 and nightwatchman Andrew Caddick for seven . 
Alec Stewart was unbeaten on 40 at the close . 
England , demoralised by a 3-0 one-day whitewash at the hands of Zimbabwe , have only two first-class matches in which to find their form before facing New Zealand in the first test in Auckland on January 24 .
