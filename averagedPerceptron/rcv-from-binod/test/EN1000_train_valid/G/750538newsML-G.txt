U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday portrayed Vincent &quot; The chin &quot; Gigante as an iron-fisted crime boss who banned mobsters from saying his name and who checked into hospitals to avoid arrest . 
assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Weissmann carefully detailed the 21-count indictment against Gigante in closing arguments in the Brooklyn federal murder and racketeering trial of the alleged boss of the Genovese crime family . 
in response , defence attorneys for Gigante said the government relied on mob informants -- &quot; stone-cold killers &quot; and &quot; psychopathic monsters &quot; -- to testify against their client . 
six mobsters-turned-informants testified , as did a dozen law enforcement agents , during 19 days of testimony . 
U.S. District Court Judge Jack Weinstein was expected to give the jury its instructions on Wednesday morning and deliberations were expected to begin later in the day . 
the prosecution and defence rested their cases on Monday . 
Gigante is charged with ordering seven murders , plotting to kill three other people , rigging business bids and extortion . 
his attorneys , who did not call any witnesses in the trial , say he is incapacitated by mental illness . 
Gigante is known for wandering the neighbourhood around his Greenwich Village apartment in a tattered bathrobe . 
but authorities say he feigns mental illness to avoid prosecution . 
&quot; Vincent Gigante didn &apos;t want people to use his name , he wants to be an invisible man , he wants to be erased , but you can &apos;t erase yourself in the minds and more importantly in the tongues of your co-conspirators , &quot; Weissmann said . 
Gigante , sitting in a wheelchair , looked more alert than usual . 
he looked at the jury and at one point smoothed down his hair . 
his attorneys argued that the informants were witnesses willing to modify their testimony to serve the government . 
&quot; What the government is asking you to do is to believe the uncorroborated testimony of the six murdering psychopaths , &quot; said the lead defence attorney , Michael Marinaccio , in his closing argument . 
&quot; These six spent a lifetime lying . 
Marinaccio also displayed a chart of the 50 murder victims of the six informants . 
he argued that none of the government &apos;s audiotapes linked Gigante to any of the charges in the indictment and said there are no photos of Gigante with any of the informants . 
&quot; The government &apos;s case amounts to little more than throwing mud at the wall and seeing what sticks , &quot; he said .
