former England soccer captain Tony Adams admitted on Saturday he is an alcoholic . 
it &apos;s okay . 
the Arsenal defender added : &quot; It &apos;s my way of life . 
&quot; I have a lot of things to do and a lot of things to work on myself and I am doing it . 
Adams , 29 , was talking as it emerged that he lapsed into his drink crisis after England &apos;s dramatic penalty shoot-out with Germany in the Euro 96 championships in June . 
according to a friend , the Arsenal centre-half had his first drink for more than four months in the hours after the national team went out of the tournament in a nail-biting finish to the match at Wembley . 
bitterly disappointed at coming so close to glory in what he feared would be his last major championship , he went for a &quot; quiet drink &quot; after the game . 
but he continued drowning his sorrows into the night and on the following day he was drinking again with friends . 
the friend said : &quot; He fought tremendously to stay on the straight and narrow . 
but after the disappointment of Germany he got home and all his problems just seemed to be magnified in the gloom of the defeat . 
it was breaking point . 
it was the end of a period of abstinence which had started at the end of February and he was a noticeable absentee from the antics of some of the players on the tour to China and Hong Kong when a plane was damaged on the way home . 
on the night several England players were pictured in a bar having tequila poured down their throats , Adams was in bed at the team hotel , determined to conquer his drink problem . 
but after the Germany semifinal , his resolve broke , triggering again the problems he has now formally recognised by visits to alcoholics Anonymous . 
Saturday &apos;s news is the latest major blow for Arsenal , beleaguered by the recent loss of manager Bruce Rioch and their stand-in coach Stewart Houston , who quit on Friday . 
Adams told reporters at the club &apos;s training ground on Saturday that the turning point in his drink dependency had come when &quot; I looked at myself in the mirror &quot; . 
his problems included a breakdown in his marriage after his 30-year-old wife Jane received treatment for cocaine addiction . 
for most of this year , the big centre half has been battling against injury . 
the only serious run of competitive games he has had was in Euro 96 and he has not played for Arsenal this season . 
David Davies , director of public affairs at the Football Association , expressing deep concern , said : &quot; Tony Adams can be assured of our total support in sorting out any problems he has . 
&quot; His role as England captain during Euro 96 has been widely and rightly recognised as considerable . 
Adams &apos;s problems mirror the difficulties suffered by his Arsenal team mate Paul Merson , who is being rehabilitated for his drink , drug and gambling problems . 
it is reported that Adams approached Merson , who as well as facing up to his own problems is also anxious to help others who are in trouble . 
on Saturday , a close friend of both players , said : &quot; The biggest hurdle is admitting the problem and Tony realises there is a very big battle ahead . 
&quot; But he is a man who has led his country so there is no doubt about his strength and commitment to face up to reality . 
Adams , who has won 45 England caps , is said to have made his confession at a meeting of the players called by Arsenal &apos;s new caretaker manager Pat Rice , who was appointed on Friday . 
his team mates were well aware of Adams &apos;s problems with drink . 
in December 1990 he was jailed for four months for drink-driving following a crash . 
in 1993 he needed stitches to a head wound after falling down stairs at a nightclub . 
later that year he was involved with a team mate in an incident at a pizza restaurant when customers were sprayed with a fire extinguisher . 
but his record on the pitch has been impressive , leading Arsenal to two league championships , two league cup victories , an F.A. 
Cup final triumph and success in the European Cup Winners &apos; Cup .
