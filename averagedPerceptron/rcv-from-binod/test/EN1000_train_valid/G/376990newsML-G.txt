Britain &apos;s opposition Labour party launched a parliamentary bid on Wednesday to sack Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg , in a move which could force Prime Minister John Major &apos;s hand over the date of the election . 
the so-called shadow cabinet , the men and women who will form the government if the Labour party wins the looming election , decided to use time alloted to them for a debate on Monday to attack Hogg &apos;s handling of the &quot; mad cow &quot; crisis . 
if Labour wins the debate , Hogg would be forced to resign and a vote of no-confidence in Major &apos;s beleagured Conservative administration could be triggered later in the week . 
senior Labour sources said they were not yet speculating about a no-confidence vote because the parliamentary arithmetic was not yet in the opposition &apos;s favour . 
the Conservative party immediately dismissed the challenge , accusing Labour of indulging in &quot; parliamentary gimmicks &quot; . 
&quot; We are confident of winning the debate . 
Parliament has had ample opportunity to discuss this issue over the past year and the government is taking forward policies to deal with this complicated issue in a responsible manner . 
but if the government loses Monday night &apos;s vote , Major &apos;s position would be precarious . 
the prime minister &apos;s favoured date for an election is May 1 , just three weeks before the final electoral deadline . 
the Conservatives have now been in office for an unbroken 18 years . 
but , with Labour some 20 points up in polls , there is frenzied speculation Major may call the election earlier to avoid an expected defeat in a parliamentary by-election scheduled in Wirral , northeast England , on February 27 . 
&quot; It &apos;s about pressure ( on Major ) , &quot; said a Labour source about Monday &apos;s vote . 
&quot; More pressure , more pressure , more pressure . 
the Conservatives are currently tied with all the opposition parties , although they have 51 seats more than Labour . 
but if Labour wins the backing of other opposition parties , many of whom are furious at the government &apos;s handling of the mad cow crisis , Major would have to ensure that all his members of parliament , even MPs who are seriously ill , turn up to vote . 
major &apos;s main ally among the opposition parties has been the Ulster Unionists , a party from Northern Ireland committed to maintaining continued British rule in the province . 
but Northern Ireland farmers have been hit by a European export ban on British beef , which many believe was imposed because Hogg failed to warn the European Union in advance about research linking mad cow disease , or bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) with a lethal human illness . 
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has said he will approach each vote on its merits and there was no immediate endorsement from sources in his party for Labour &apos;s plans . 
whatever happens in the vote , Labour &apos;s leader Tony Blair is determined to win maximum political capital out it . 
he ordered Deputy Leader John Prescott to launch a media campaign to attack Hogg , and the government &apos;s competence .
