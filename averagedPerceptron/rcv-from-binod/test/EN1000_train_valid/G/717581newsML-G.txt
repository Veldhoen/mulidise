a German court ruled on Wednesday that Chancellor Helmut Kohl &apos;s Christian Democrats ( CDU ) were within their rights to exclude members of the Church of Scientology from the party . 
the Bonn court rejected a claim by three Scientologists that the CDU had violated their right to freedom of religion by shutting them out of the party . 
the case was the latest tussle in a long battle between Germany and the controversial group . 
Germany does not recognise Scientology as a religion , believing it to be a business which exploits the weaknesses of its members for profit . 
the church denies the accusation . 
Scientology spokeswoman Sabine Weber , who was in court to hear the verdict , expressed disappointment at the decision . 
&quot; We would advise our members to take further legal steps , &quot; she told reporters , predicting the case could go all the way to the European Court of Human Rights . 
the Bonn court said the decisive factor was not whether or not Scientology was a religion . 
&quot; Parties are permitted to exclude those from their organisation who do not identify with their main aims , regardless of whether this is religiously motivated or not , &quot; the court said in a statement .
