British police quizzed jailed guerrilla mastermind &quot; Carlos the jackal &quot; in Paris on Tuesday over the shooting of a top British businessman in 1973 and the 1974 bombing of a London bank , judicial sources said . 
three Scotland Yard officers , whose previous bid to question Venezuelan-born Carlos foundered last month when he refused to cooperate in a protest at his guards , grilled the guerrilla on the two cases at the law courts on Tuesday afternoon . 
but justice sources said afterwards that Carlos , whose real name is Illich Ramirez Sanchez , refused to admit involvement in the attacks and dismissed their investigations as &quot; Zionist provocations &quot; . 
the officers &apos; questioning focussed on the attempted assassination in December 1973 of Joseph Edward Sieff , late chairman of retailer Marks &amp; Spencer , outside his London home , and on the January 1974 bombing of the Hapoalim Bank in London , in which there were no injuries . 
Sieff , who was vice-president of the Zionist Federation in Britain which gave aid to Israel , miraculously survived after a gunman shot him in the face . 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) , which Carlos backed at the time , claimed responsibility for the shooting . 
Carlos reportedly told Al Watan al Arabi , a Paris-based magazine , in 1979 that he had been responsible for both the shooting and the bank bombing . 
but since his arrest in August 1994 Carlos has said the interview was a fake . 
last month , Carlos refused to leave his prison cell to meet the British investigators , accusing his guards of taking away his belt . 
prison guards routinely take belts and shoelaces away from inmates to prevent possible suicide . 
French police accuse Carlos of killing 83 people in a series of attacks in Europe and the Middle East . 
his boldest attack was the kidnapping of 11 OPEC oil ministers in Vienna in 1975 .
