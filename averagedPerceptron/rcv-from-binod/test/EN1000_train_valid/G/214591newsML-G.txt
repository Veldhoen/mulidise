Ireland on Monday invited Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to dinner during next month &apos;s European Council , but again failed to win agreement for a formal meeting on EU-Turkish relations . 
tensions between Ankara and Athens have posed problems for EU-Turkish relations for some years . 
the two NATO allies almost went to war in January over disputed , uninhabited islets in the Aegean Sea . 
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos told reporters at the General Affairs Council that the invitation to Erbakan had been made by Ireland , as EU president , rather than by the foreign ministers . 
he declined to say whether the Greek Prime Minister would attend the dinner , scheduled for December 14 , but said Greece would always want to be present at any EU event . 
Erbakan &apos;s predecessor Tansu Ciller , a pro-Western secularist , previously attended EU summit events , but this is the first invitation extended to Islamist Erbakan . 
in July , EU foreign ministers adopted a common position on EU-Turkish relations , effectively supporting Greece in asking Turkey to take a dispute over the Aegean islands to the International Court of Justice in The Hague . 
Turkey has yet to respond formally to this , although Ciller has recently said the dispute is a bilateral one and nothing to do with the EU . 
appealing for continued dialogue with Ankara , German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters : &quot; Turkey is a bridge to the Islamic world and a bridge to the Asian world .
