Taiwan said on Friday it had no plan to return 16 mainland hijackers to rival China in exchange for a Taiwan man who forced an airliner to fly to the Chinese city of Xiamen this month . 
&quot; We absolutely have no plan to repatriate ( the Chinese hijackers ) , &quot; Kao Koong-lian , vice chairman and spokesman of the cabinet &apos;s mainland Affairs Council , told a news conference . 
Beijing on Thursday agreed to repatriate hijacker Liu Shan-chung , but called on the island to send back the 16 in return . 
Liu , 45 , a jobless journalist , doused himself with gasoline and commandeered the airliner to China on March 10 , complaining of political repression at home . 
&quot; This is a judicial issue , instead of a swap of prisoners , &quot; he said . 
most of the 16 mainland hijackers the island has kept since 1993 are serving prison terms in Taiwan . 
Kao said only when Taiwan and China had reached formal agreement on repatriation of hijackers would Taiwan consider sending the 16 back . 
if China wanted to resolve the hijacker repatriation issue , it should authorise the semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait in Beijing to talk with its Taiwan counterpart , the Straits Exchange Foundation , Kao said . 
the association is Beijing &apos;s body for handling contacts with Taiwan , which Beijing has regarded as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949 . 
Kao said the 16 Chinese hijackers were detained before Taiwan and China reached any consensus on what to do with hijacking , and it was necessary for the sides to resume talks . 
the 16 commandeered 12 mainland airliners to Taiwan between April 6 , 1993 , and June 6 , 1994 . 
China suspended semi-official talks with Taiwan in retaliaton for a trip to the United States in June 1995 by the island &apos;s president , Lee Teng-hui . 
Beijing , which views Taiwan as a rebel-held province , interpreted that trip as an attempt to promote Taiwan &apos;s independence , which China refuses to consider . 
Kao said the return of hijackers differed from sending back Chinese or Taiwan stowaways , whose repatriation is conducted under the 1990 Kinmen Agreement . 
China &apos;s official Xinhua news agency said on Thursday Beijing had decided in line with the Kinmen Agreement to send back hijacker Liu . 
but Kao said the Kinmen pact was only for the repatriation of stowaways .
