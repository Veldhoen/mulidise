opening batsman Graeme Vimpani scored his maiden first-class century on Thursday before Victoria were bowled out for 354 on the opening day of a four-day match against West Indies . 
poor fielding again hampered the West Indies as they prepare for next week &apos;s third test against Australia . 
the tourists dropped three catches and allowed 38 extras , gifting the Victoria state side a larger total than otherwise could have been expected . 
West Indies acting captain Brian Lara had earlier said his side may have turned the corner after Tuesday &apos;s seven-wicket defeat of Pakistan in a World Series limited overs match , ending a run of seven successive defeats . 
pace Bowler Nixon McLean proved the exception to the rule and took five wickets , including dismissals with his last two deliveries to be on a hat trick when Victoria start their second innings . 
McLean spearheaded the West Indies attack after the pace bowling pair of captain Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose were rested for the match . 
he took four wickets in 20 balls , including tail-enders Brad Stacey and Damien Fleming with successive balls to close out the day and finish with five for 48 from 13.2 overs . 
spin Bowler Jimmy Adams , who took a career-best five wickets against Pakistan on Tuesday , finished with three for 52 . 
Vimpani hit 17 boundaries in an innings lasting 202 deliveries after acting captain Dean Jones won the toss . 
Victoria were in a strong position at 221 for four before McLean struck . 
West Indies suffered heavy defeats in the first two tests of the five-test series against Australia and also dropped their first two matches of the World Series tournament against the same opponents .
