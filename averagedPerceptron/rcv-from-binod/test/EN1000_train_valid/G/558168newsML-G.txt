Islamabad , May 3 , Reuter - Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif invited his new British counterpart Tony Blair to visit Pakistan as Islamabad praised his victorious Labour party &apos;s policies towards South Asia . 
a Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman , quoted by the official APP news agency on Saturday , said the &quot; most cordial invitation &quot; for the visit was contained in a greeting message Sharif sent to Blair on his taking office after Labour &apos;s massive election victory . 
the spokesman said Pakistan was confident that its &quot; traditional ties of deep friendship and understanding ( with Britain ) will be further reinforced and strengthened now that both countries are led by bold and progressive leaders &quot; . 
he said Labour had &quot; always taken keen interest in issues affecting peace and stability in South Asia and supported resolution of all issues on the basis of justice and equity &quot; . 
this seemed to be a reference to a Labour national executive committee resolution in 1995 that said the party , when in power , would help negotiate a peace settlement in the India-Pakistan dispute over the Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir . 
Blair was quoted by India &apos;s Hindustan Times newspaper recently as saying his government would seek to help negotiate an agreement on Kashmir . 
India says the issue can be discussed only bilaterally with Pakistan , without the involvement of a third party . 
Pakistan says outside help would be welcome to help resolve the dispute . 
more than 20,000 people have been killed in the Indian part of Kashmir since 1990 when simmering discontent with New Delhi &apos;s rule turned into an armed rebellion .
