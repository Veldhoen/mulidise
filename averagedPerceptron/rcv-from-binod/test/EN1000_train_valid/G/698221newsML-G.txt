Indonesian tennis took a giant leap on Tuesday when Yayuk Basuki became the first player from that country to reach the women &apos;s singles quarter-finals at Wimbledon , beating Canadian Patricia Hy-Boulais in straight sets . 
it &apos;s a moment in history for Indonesian tennis , &quot; Basuki said . 
&quot; This is a major grand slam tournament , and no-one from Indonesia has ever been this far . 
for me this is something special . 
hopefully my country is proud of me . 
Basuki , who has reached the last 16 here four times but never before progressed to the final eight , overpowered the Canadian with her hard-hitting and brisk movement to the net to win 6-0 7-6 ( 7-2 ) . 
she was quite nervous so I took the advantage , &quot; Basuki said . 
the compact Indonesian cruised through the first set , but in the second Hy-Boulais threatened a comeback when she won three games in a row . 
however , Hy-Boulais , 5-3 up and serving for the second set , failed to capitalise on her lead . 
Basuki &apos;s surge to the net and powerful return of serve cost the Canadian that game . 
&quot; She was serving for the set , she didn &apos;t take it and I felt a lot more positive , &quot; Basuki said . 
Basuki started and finished the next game with an ace , while Hy-Boulais was clearly frustrated with her inability to move quickly enough after her serve . 
&quot; Move ! 
serve and move ! , &quot; she coached herself . 
Basuki maintained the momentum and polished off her opponent 7-2 in a speedy tie break . 
but Basuki conceded Tuesday &apos;s game was no walkover . 
the cheerful 26-year-old from Jakarta is just planning to enjoy the rest of the tournament . 
she faces a hard match in the last eight against either Mary Joe Fernandez or Jana Novotna . 
&quot; It &apos;s going to be a tough quarter-final but I have nothing to lose . 
it &apos;s one of my favourite places to play , &quot; she said . 
Basuki became the first Indonesian to win a professional event at the 1991 Volvo Ladies Open .
