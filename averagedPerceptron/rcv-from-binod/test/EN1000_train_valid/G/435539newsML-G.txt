Juventus defender Moreno Torricelli will probably be out of competitive soccer for the rest of the season after suffering a severe knee ligament injury in Sunday &apos;s 0-0 draw against Inter Milan , Italian newspapers reported on Wednesday . 
he is due to have his right knee operated on next week . 
newspapers said he would probably be out for six or seven months and was unlikely to play a competitive match before the start of the new season next September -- a hard blow for Juventus as they seek to retain their European Cup crown and win the Italian league . 
&quot; This is a very serious handicap for us , &quot; Juventus coach Marcello Lippi said . 
&quot; But one of our secrets is the ability of our reserves to step in ready and willing just when we need them . 
Torricelli said he hoped to learn from the example of team mates Atillio Lombardo and Antonio Conte , both of whom have recently recovered from serious injuries . 
&quot; Conte told me that I &apos;ve just got to be patient and keep believing and defeat the boredom of physiotherapy ... by saying to myself that every day passed is one day closer to my comeback , &quot; he said .
