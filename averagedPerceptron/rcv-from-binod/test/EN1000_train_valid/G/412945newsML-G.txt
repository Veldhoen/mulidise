premier Li Peng said on Saturday China would pursue a foreign policy of opening to the world pioneered by late leader Deng Xiaoping , citing ties with the United States and Europe as of particular importance . 
Li , speaking at the start of the annual session of China &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress , or parliament , placed less emphasis on relations with Japan , China &apos;s neighbour and biggest trading partner . 
he delivered his speech in Beijing &apos;s Great Hall of the People , a Maoist-era auditorium evocative of an earlier , less outward-looking period in communist China &apos;s foreign policy . 
&quot; China will unswervingly pursue the policy of opening to the outside world ... , &quot; Li said after he and 2,800-odd parliamentary deputies had observed a brief silence for Deng , who died on February 19 aged 92 . 
&quot; We wish to see further improvement in Sino-U.S. relations and the strengthening of Sino-European relations , &quot; he said , without going into detail . 
China this week marked the 25th anniversary of the Shanghai communique -- the starting point for the process of normalising Sino-U.S. relations -- by criticising Washington for failing to honour the terms of its agreements . 
relations between China and the United States deteriorated in 1995 and early 1996 due to disputes ranging from Taiwan to pirated software and illegal garbage shipments , and have improved only in recent months . 
both sides seemed happy with this week &apos;s visit to Beijing by new U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright . 
Li referred to ties with Japan briefly . 
&quot; Sino-Japanese relations were once obstructed . 
we wish to see a normal development of relations between the two countries , &quot; he said . 
recent strains between the World War Two foes have included a flare-up in a long-standing dispute , also involving Taiwan and Hong Kong , over ownership of islets called Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese . 
Li said China opposed interference in the internal affairs of other countries -- an apparent jab at outsiders who take China to task over its human rights record . 
China is to announce on Sunday a 14.7 percent incrrease in its defence budget for 1997 , Chinese sources said , but Li said China had no aggressive intentions . 
&quot; A developed China will not constitute a threat to any other country , &quot; he said . 
Beijing defends its large increases in military spending by saying the base figure is still low and inflation cuts purchasing power . 
China denies charges it is becoming a threat in Asia or to the rest of the world , but its military build-up has caused anxiety among neighbours . 
the three-million-strong People &apos;s Liberation Army , the biggest in the world , ruffled feathers in the region in March 1996 when it held missile tests and war games close to Taiwan just before the island &apos;s presidential election .
