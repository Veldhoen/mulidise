the Lima hostage crisis went into its fifth month on Thursday with hopes for the release of 72 exhausted hostages pinned on frenetic behind-the-scenes talks between the key players . 
there was little cheer for relatives , who are increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ( MRTA ) . 
&quot; Every day it is more difficult to handle this situation ... Time is our worst enemy , &quot; said Lucy de Cordova , wife of former Prime Minister Dante Cordova , who is among the hostages . 
&quot; Every day we sense ( the hostages ) are more exhausted , every day the families are more exhausted . 
this is why our cry is for a quick solution . 
the mainly middle-aged hostages have spent more than 17 weeks under the gun in the cramped and sweltering Japanese ambassador &apos;s residence that was stormed by a group of jungle-trained MRTA guerrillas on Dec . 17 . 
a three-man team overseeing crisis talks has been carrying on a daily shuttle diplomacy between government and rebels . 
their secret meetings have led to speculation that a negotiated settlement is imminent , but a poll published this week showed that most Peruvians fear the standoff -- already the longest hostage situation in Latin America &apos;s history -- could last for months . 
the main sticking point remains the MRTA demand for the release of hundreds of jailed comrades . 
President Alberto Fujimori has publicly ruled this out although sources close to the talks suggest the government may be prepared to free some lesser MRTA prisoners to avoid bloodshed . 
Fujimori has already arranged asylum for the 20-odd rebels in Cuba in the event of a peaceful solution , and Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina reiterated in Tokyo on Thursday that Havana would do &quot; whatever it can &quot; to speed a solution . 
&quot; President Fujimori has offered from the outset and has recently given his word that this will have a peaceful solution , so let it be soon please , &quot; urged Luisa de Sivina , wife of a high-ranking judge held hostage , Hugo Sivina . 
the captives maintain contact with their families via twice-weekly messages and special broadcasts on local radio . 
the guerrillas , who have mined and booby trapped the diplomatic compound , initially seized more than 500 guests at an embassy party but later freed most of them . 
they still hold the ambassadors of Japan and Bolivia , two dozen Japanese diplomats and businessmen , two government ministers and Fujimori &apos;s younger brother .
