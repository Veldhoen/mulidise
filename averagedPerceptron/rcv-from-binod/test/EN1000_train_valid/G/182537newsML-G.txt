NASA started its countdown for this week &apos;s launch of the Colombia space shuttle on Tuesday despite a dismal weather forecast , as engineers cleared up a technical hitch that might have delayed takeoff . 
but the weather outlook for the 2 1 / 2-hour launch opportunity was one of the most dismal the shuttle has faced , with meteorologists predicting high winds , low clouds and a chance of showers at the launch site . 
&quot; Right now it looks pretty ominous , &quot; said shuttle weather officer Ed Priselac . 
recovery of the shuttle &apos;s spent solid rocket boosters from the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida would be made difficult by high seas and strong winds . 
clouds and rain were also likely to close the shuttle &apos;s emergency landing strips in Spain and Africa . 
Priselac gave Columbia a 1-in-5 chance of making it off the launch pad on Friday . 
the forecast was no better for Saturday and was unlikely to improve until early next week , he said . 
the weather was also likely to delay the planned Wednesday launch of an Atlas rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Station , Priselac said . 
that , in turn , would push back Columbia &apos;s launch by one day , because the Atlas could make a second launch attempt on Thursday . 
the Lockheed Martin Corp. rocket uses the same U.S. Air Force tracking facilities needed for the shuttle launch , and it takes about 48 hours to readjust the equipment . 
engineers determined on Tuesday that a coolant leak in one of the shuttle &apos;s three electricity-generating fuel cells would not require repairs . 
tests revealed the leak was within safety limits , said NASA spokesman George Diller . 
Columbia &apos;s crew of five astronauts arrived at the Florida launch site on Monday evening to begin final preparations for blastoff . 
during the 16-day mission , the shuttle crew will release and later retrieve a pair of science satellites and make two spacewalks to practice for space station assembly .
