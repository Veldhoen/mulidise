France on Friday called for restraint from all sides in a dispute over local elections in Serbia and recalled the European Union made respect for democracy a condition for normalising relations with Belgrade . 
foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said Paris was concerned by the stalemate between President Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s Socialists , trying to annul local election results they lost , and opposition attempts to secure their victory . 
&quot; It is essential that a democratic solution be found , &quot; Rummelhardt told reporters at a news briefing . 
&quot; Respect of democratic norms is among the first conditions set by the European Union to normalise relations with ( rump ) Yugoslavia . 
students and opposition leaders were demonstrating on Friday in a fifth day of protests in Belgrade and towns across Serbia to demand the results of last Sunday &apos;s polls be recognised .
