the Philadelphia district attorney &apos;s office Friday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an emergency appeal of an order to reopen the case of convicted murderer Gary Heidnik . 
the appeal is aimed at setting aside an order that prevents the state from executing Heidnik , 53 , by lethal injection for two sadistic murders a decade ago . 
Deputy District Attorney Ronald Eisenberg said papers were filed Friday afternoon . 
if the high court refuses to hear the appeal or upholds the appeals court , the case would enter a quiet spell after a frantic four days in which three issues were contested in four courts . 
&quot; This could drag on for years , &quot; Eisenberg said . 
Heidnik , who has spent 10 years on death row for kidnapping and torturing six women , killing two of them , had been scheduled to die by lethal injection at 10 p.m. EDT last Tuesday . 
the state could appeal through normal channels as a result of the decision of a three-judge panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals , but that would likely take a year or more . 
the appeals court opinion released early Friday found Heidnik incapable of making a rational decison on his legal rights . 
it directed U.S. District Judge Franklin Van Antwerpen to appoint lawyers to represent Heidnik and his daughter , Maxine Davidson White , whom the appeals court named as his &quot; next friend &quot; or guardian for purposes of his criminal case . 
that would not only block his execution but enable lawyers to reopen the case . 
van Antwerpen appointed Robert Dunham and Billy Nolas of the Centre for Legal Education , Advocacy and Defence Assistance . 
the state Supreme Court also will have a say in the case . 
it granted lawyers an indefinite stay on their appeal , giving the Third Circuit time to make its ruling . 
Heidnik claimed insanity at his 1988 trial but a jury convicted him and sentenced him to death . 
police arrested Heidnik after a woman escaped from his North Philadelphia rowhouse in 1987 , saying he had shackled her and five other women in a cellar converted to a torture chamber for months . 
he was accused of dismembering the body of one woman who died of starvation and feeding some of her remains to the others . 
he killed a second woman by attaching live wires to her chains while she stood in a pit filled with water . 
police found body parts in Heidnik &apos;s freezer that belonged to the woman he dismembered . 
the second victim &apos;s body was found dumped in a state forest in New Jersey . 
the remaining women were found alive .
