Greece will give thousands of illegal immigrants residence and work permits , the labour ministry said on Thursday . 
&quot; There are more than 400,000 illegal immigrants in Greece and if we don &apos;t take measures there will be around a million by the year 2000 , &quot; Labour Minister Miltiadis Papaioannou told a news conference . 
he said illegal migrants would have two months to submit applications to stay . 
&quot; registering these people will be a very difficult task but we have to do something about it . 
the new law is based on similar ones in Italy , France and Portugal , &quot; he said . 
the immigrants would be given a maximum nine-month work and residence permit free of charge . 
they would then be able to receive social security benefits but must also file tax statements , Papaioannou said . 
Ministry officials told Reuters that when the initial permits expire , the immigrants would be granted new ones valid for up to five years . 
&quot; Only those immigrants who have the first permit will be eligible for the second . 
those who don &apos;t apply will be considered illegal and will be immediately expelled , &quot; one official said . 
Papaioannou said border patrols would be increased to stop aliens entering the country illegally . 
most illegal immigrants in Greece are from Albania and the Philippines . 
many others come from Poland , Iraq , Bulgaria and the former Soviet republics . 
most of them clean houses or work on farms or in filling stations , restaurants and nightclubs to support families at home .
