Commonwealth Foreign Ministers on Tuesday delayed taking further action against Nigeria , which has been suspended from the group over its human rights record . 
the ministers expressed concern over delayed elections and political detainees being held without trial . 
but they decided to hear more evidence before making their recommendations to heads of government in the 53-nation grouping , who are to hold a summit in Edinburgh in October . 
Nigeria was suspended from the grouping of Britain and its former colonies in November 1995 after it defied world opinion by hanging nine activists , including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa . 
Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues , who campaigned for minority rights for the Ogoni tribe , had been found guilty of inciting the murder of four pro-government chiefs . 
the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group ( CMAG ) , which is made up of the foreign ministers of eight Commonwealth nations , visited Nigeria last November and met in London on Tuesday to review progress . 
CMAG , whose visit was branded a failure by Nigerian opposition groups because it only met government representatives , decided &quot; to invite further written submissions from all interested parties . 
that provoked a sharp rebuke from Britain &apos;s opposition Labour Party , opinion poll favourites to win the next election due by May . 
the only people who will take comfort from this are the military junta in Nigeria , &quot; said Labour Foreign Affairs spokesman Tony Lloyd . 
but Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge , the chairman of CMAG , defended its effectiveness . 
&quot; This is a continuing process . 
our mandate is to monitor and assess . 
we hope that the exercise is edging the Nigerian authorities towards more democracy and respect for human rights , &quot; he said . 
&quot; We have to be hopeful . 
we have no alternative . 
even if it gets tough sometimes , we have no choice , &quot; he told a news conference . 
Ghanaian Foreign Minister Mohamed Chambas also counselled patience , telling reporters : &quot; Democracy , like Rome , was not built in a day . 
it is an evolutionary process . 
we have no doubt the Nigerian people want democracy . 
Nigerian military ruler Sani Abacha has remained defiant in the face of Commonwealth pressure , deftly exploiting splits within the group and refusing to bring forward plans to restore civil rule before 1998 . 
but Zimbabwe &apos;s Mudenge insisted there were no Commonwealth splits at the London meeting . 
&quot; There is no division . 
we are all in agreement . 
their unanimously agreed statement expressed concern over continued detentions without trial in Nigeria and said local government elections had now been delayed by three months . 
at their two-day stock-taking in London , the ministers also reviewed developments in Sierra Leone and Gambia . 
the two sides in the Sierra Leone conflict were urged to stick to a peace accord hammered out last November . 
they said Gambia still suffered from &quot; a flawed political process &quot; but acknowledged that January &apos;s parliamentary elections were held in a freer atmosphere than last September &apos;s presidential elections .
