Belgium said on Wednesday it was gravely concerned about reported fresh massacres in Burundi . 
&quot; We are very worried about the deterioration of the security situation in Burundi , &quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Andre Querton said , commenting on a United Nations report that over 1,000 people had been killed since the start of December . 
he said the report , published earlier on Wednesday , said some 1,100 people had died in the seven most recent weeks at the hands of Burundi &apos;s mainly Tutsi army and its Hutu opponents . 
&quot; Belgium condemns the massacres in the strongest terms , &quot; he said . 
both sides routinely deny killing civilians and blame each other for massacres . 
Tutsis are outnumbered four-to-one in Burundi , a former Belgian protectorate , and many fear they will perish unless they retain full control of the army and block real power-sharing with Hutus .
