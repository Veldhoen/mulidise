Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani on Tuesday welcomed U.S. missile strikes against Iraqi military targets , but said they had so far failed to deter tank and artillery movements toward his rebel positions . 
&quot; Forty Iraqi tanks , as well as artillery , moved from Qushtapa toward Bustaneh about one hour ago . 
their advance has been stopped by the peshmerga ( guerrilla ) resistance , &quot; Talabani told Reuters from his Iraqi Kurdistan stronghold of Sulaymaniya , more than 100 km ( 60 miles ) to the southeast . 
he said the Iraqi troop movements came shortly after 25-30 U.S. cruise missiles were launched against military targets in southern Iraq -- approximately 1000 km ( 600 miles ) away from the Kurdish-held north . 
Talabani , whose Patriotic Union of Kurdistan was ousted from the Kurdish city of Arbil by Iraqi forces at the weekend , said he expected further U.S. attacks should Baghdad not withdraw from the area at once . 
&quot; This is just the hors d &apos;oeuvre of the conflict , &quot; he said of the U.S. strike . 
&quot; This is not the main course . 
&quot; We thank President ( Bill ) Clinton for his brave humanitarian action against the Iraqi leadership in the only langauge ( Iraqi President ) Saddam Hussein understands .
