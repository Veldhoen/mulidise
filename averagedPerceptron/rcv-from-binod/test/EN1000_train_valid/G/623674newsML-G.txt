U.S. officials on Thursday expressed cautious optimism that a suspect held in Canada over the massive truck bombing in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 U.S. servicemen last year will be sent to the United States soon . 
&quot; It does look promising that he will be brought to the United States , &quot; said one official familiar with the continuing delicate discussions involving the suspect , Hani Abdel-Rahim Hussein al-Sayegh , who is being held in an Ottawa prison . 
&quot; We are closer to some sort of an agreement . 
progress is being made , &quot; the official said , adding that Canada may decide soon on deporting Sayegh to the United States rather than his native country of Saudi Arabia . 
asked if Sayegh would be deported to the United States , another source familiar with the matter told Reuters : &quot; I think that &apos;s likely going to be the case . 
the source said since the conditional deportation order was issued on May 14 Sayegh &apos;s lawyers had been negotiating with U.S. authorities . 
&quot; He ( Sayegh ) was trying to get the best possible deal in terms of coming back here . 
the deportation decision will be made by Lucienne Robillard , Canada &apos;s minister of citizenship and immigration . 
U.S. officials said the problem has been reaching a firm agreement with Sayegh . 
among the issues to be resolved are his legal status when brought to the United States and what considerations , if any , he might receive if he cooperates . 
&quot; They are very fragile discussions . 
they have gone back and forth for some time . 
he &apos;s very wishy-washy , &quot; one official said . 
&quot; He keeps changing his mind &quot; on whether he will cooperate and what he will receive in return . 
among issues to be resolved , officials said it still had to be decided whether Sayegh would be brought to the United States as a witness , a subject of the investigation or a suspect . 
he has been identified in Canadian court documents as the driver of a car that gave the go-ahead signal for the bomb-laden truck involved in the attack on Khobar Towers . 
U.S. officials have long sought to question Sayegh about the June attack on the compound that housed U.S. military personnel in Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia . 
the bombing killed 19 Americans and injured hundreds . 
one official described it as a difficult decision for Sayegh . 
&quot; He is in a a foreign country . 
he is wondering , &apos; What will happen to me ? 
what will happen to my family ? 
&apos; He may never see his homeland again . 
the official estimated there was a 30 to 40 percent chance Sayegh would be sent to the United States in the next few days . 
if he is , he may become the first witness the FBI has directly questioned in its probe of the bombing . 
Saudi Arabia has refused to allowed U.S. officials direct access to any suspects or witnesses . 
the officials said it was unclear how much Sayegh knew about the bombing . 
Sayegh &apos;s Canadian lawyer previously has made known his client &apos;s strong preference to avoid deportation to Saudi Arabia , where he faces possible execution . 
but U.S. officials said Canada was not required to send Sayegh where he wanted . 
at the weekly Justice Department briefing , Acting Deputy Attorney General Seth Waxman declined comment about the case . 
&quot; When and if an action is taken , we will let you know . 
but this is a matter that is under investigation and I don &apos;t think it would be appropriate or consistent with law enforcement and national security to comment on it , &quot; he said .
