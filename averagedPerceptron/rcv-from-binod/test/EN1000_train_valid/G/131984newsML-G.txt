Cambodia is still seeking peace and democracy five years after warring factions agreed to lay down arms but the Asian nation has notched up political , social and economic gains , analysts and officials said . 
the internal problems of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas could prove a major turning point for peace but risk polarising the political scene with rival parties seeking the loyalty of different rebel factions . 
the problem is linked to a simmering row over power-sharing between the two leading ruling coalition parties , the royalist FUNCINPEC and the ex-communist Cambodian People &apos;s Party ( CPP ) , and analysts believe the differences will resurface ahead of elections which must be held by May 1998 . 
the government has set a ceremony and royal banquet on Wednesday to celebrate the anniversary of the October 23 , 1991 Paris peace accords , which led to the dispatch of a $ 2 billion U.N. peace-keeping mission to Cambodia . 
the uneasy coalition of former enemies was forged after U.N.-run general elections in May 1993 , which were boycotted by the Khmer Rouge after they reneged on the Paris pact . 
a September 1993 constitution restored the monarchy and embraced a multi-party democracy and a free market economy . 
&quot; We have more freedoms , more human rights , more democracy and obviously we have more prosperity . 
the two or three billion dollar investment of the international community was very worthwhile , &quot; said Lao mong Hay , director of the Khmer Institute of Democracy . 
but he noted , &quot; We have not been able to implement the administrative reform so as to strengthen the state apparatus commensurate with the ( envisioned pluralistic liberal democratic ) political system . 
&quot; This is a major setback alongside the continuing warfare . 
Co-Defence Minister Tea Banh agreed the war had been the main setback of the past five years , while adding : &quot; There are some guerrillas left , but their activities are decreasing day by day . 
the government &apos;s encouragement of defectors has played an important role in draining the power of the rebels in recent years , but the process accelerated dramatically when former top leader Ieng Sary broke with hardliners under Pol Pot in August . 
the defections of more than 2,500 Khmer Rouge to the government since October have compounded the rebels &apos; problems , but some analysts believe they could end up reinforcing the innate differences between the FUNCINPEC and CPP . 
&quot; They just seem to be contributing to the polarisation , &quot; said an analyst , adding : &quot; They have to make up their minds one way or the other who they &apos;re going to be associated with . 
another analyst saw the coalition problems of the past six months as jockeying for position ahead of the 1998 elections , which he and others said would be a test of the 1991 accord . 
&quot; Did the ( 1993 ) election achieve stability and peace ? 
they need another election to solve this problem , &quot; added the veteran Cambodia-watcher . 
information Minister Ieng Mouly said the peace pact had planted the seeds for reconciliation and rehabilitation , while adding : &quot; The heritage that we got from the war is so huge ... We cannot end all the difficulties in four or five years . 
Benny Widyono , special U.N. representative to Cambodia , noted economic and political progress , notably more respect for human rights , since the elections , which he saw as a watershed . 
&quot; It &apos;s like a marriage ceremony , it legalised the coalition government , &quot; he told Reuters , adding that formation of a coalition had created confidence that was reflected in the influx of foreign aid and tourists and increasing foreign and domestic investment . 
Cambodia has enjoyed steady growth since 1991 with per capita GDP forecast at around $ 300 by the end of the year against $ 119 five years ago , inflation slashed to 3.5 percent last year from 151 percent , and a local currency relatively stable at 2500 to 2700 riels to the dollar since 1993 . 
finance secretary of state Chanthol Sun said the coalition had approved foreign investment projects worth $ 2.5 billion . 
he added that recent heavy flooding would trim some indicators , with 1996 GDP ( gross domestic product ) growth now forecast at six percent and inflation at five percent .
