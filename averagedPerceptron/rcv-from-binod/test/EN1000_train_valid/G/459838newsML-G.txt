Oman &apos;s head of state , Sultan Qaboos Bin Said , will visit India from April 1 to 4 on his first official visit to the South Asian country , an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Friday . 
Qaboos on Monday cancelled a trip to India due to bad weather . 
the visit was scheduled to start on Tuesday . 
Qaboos , who will be accompanied by 10 ministers and advisers , is scheduled to meet Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma and Prime Minister H.D. 
DEVE Gowda in New Delhi . 
the two nations are due to sign an agreement on double taxation and an extradition treaty during the sultan &apos;s visit . 
India and Oman are both part of the recently inaugurated 14-member Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation . 
the two countries have carried out a feasibility study for a proposed underwater gas pipeline from Oman to India . 
but Indian officials say the project has been bogged down by a lack of political will on both sides and cash .
