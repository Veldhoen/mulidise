President Clinton signed legislation Friday that will provide $ 385 million for organisations working to promote family planning worldwide . 
Clinton signed the bill after the Senate this week joined the House of Representatives in approving a joint resolution allowing spending of $ 385 million in previously appropriated funds to start on March 1 instead of July 1 . 
its passage allows the aid to be disbursed at the rate of 8 percent a month starting in March , five months after the opening of the 1997 fiscal year . 
abortion opponents tried to block the bill , saying it would provide more than $ 100 million to organisations that supported abortion . 
the White House called passage of the bill this week &quot; a victory for women , children and families all over the world . 
Clinton had argued that to delay spending the money would deny safe and effective contraception to couples who depend on these programmes and would lead to &quot; a rise in unintended pregnancies and maternal deaths and a tragic recourse to unsafe and unsanitary methods to terminate those pregnancies . 
Congress last year voted to reduce money for international family planning programmes by 35 percent and prevent any further spending until July 1 . 
but it agreed that if the Clinton government could prove family programmes were being hurt , it would reconsider the measure in February and allow earlier release of the money .
