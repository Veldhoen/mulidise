the gun-running trial of two sons of Algerian fundamentalist opposition leader Abassi Madani was put off on Wednesday because two interpreters did not turn up on time , court officials said . 
the trial was rescheduled to open on Thursday . 
Salim and Ikbal Abassi , aged 29 and 25 , and two other Algerians , Nasr-Eddine Layachi Hemaz , 30 , and Mahmoud Logbi , 25 , are to go on trial on accusations of smuggling arms and explosives from Germany to anti-government forces in Algeria . 
the four Algerians , who all deny involvement , could face up to five years in prison if convicted on formal charges of belonging to an illegal organisation . 
they have been in custody for over a year since the authorities cracked down on Algerian fundamentalists using southern and western Germany as a base to support an armed conflict against Algeria &apos;s military rulers .
