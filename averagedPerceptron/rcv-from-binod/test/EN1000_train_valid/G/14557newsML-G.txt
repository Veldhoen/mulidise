the mother of Olympic bomb suspect Richard Jewell made a tearful plea on Monday to President Bill Clinton to clear her son &apos;s name as his lawyers vowed to file civil lawsuits over media reporting of the case . 
&quot; He cannot work . 
he cannot know any type of normal life . 
he can only sit and wait for this nightmare to end , &quot; Barbara Jewell told a news conference . 
as the head of the Justice Department and the FBI , he has a moral duty to the citizens of this country , &quot; she said , breaking into tears . 
&quot; If the FBI does not intend to charge my son , please tell us . 
please tell the world . 
Jewell has maintained his innocence since he was first named by the Atlanta Journal as a suspect in the July 27 bombing at centennial Olympic Park that killed two people and injured 111 others . 
&quot; We obviously have some very real concerns in terms of looking closely at how this story was reported by the Atlanta Journal . 
we have some concerns about how certain members of the television media commented upon this story , &quot; attorney Lin Wood said at the same news conference . 
&quot; At some point in the near future , some appropriate legal action will be instituted on behalf of Mr. Jewell in a civil proceeding , &quot; Wood said . 
he said the Journal &apos;s initial report contained false allegations and incorrectly claimed that the security guard sought publicity for himself after the bombing . 
&quot; Richard was portrayed as a matter of fact as fitting a profile . 
he does not factually fit that profile , &quot; Wood said . 
&quot; Richard Jewell , to our knowledge and from our investigation , at no time initiated any contact with the news media . 
his lawyers complained that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had had sufficient time to make a case against the former sheriff &apos;s deputy . 
&quot; We &apos;re four weeks beyond their search of his home , his automobile , his cabin where he once lived , &quot; Wood said . 
&quot; This is not the Olympic park bomber . 
Richard Jewell is an innocent man and he is a victim of some very , very cruel circumstances . 
Mrs. Jewell , an insurance claims coordinator , said her son &quot; has been convicted in the court of public opinion . 
&quot; She said the FBI had turned her apartment upside down , taking rugs , clothing , books and childrens &apos; video tapes and rifling through her personal papers , telephone directory and calendar . 
&quot; They went through my undergarments . 
they searched every inch of my home and every item in my home , &quot; she said . 
&quot; We wake up to photographers . 
we go to sleep to photographers . 
we cannot look out the windows . 
we cannot walk our dogs without being photographed and confronted , &quot; she said . 
Jewell &apos;s attorneys also said they would continue their efforts to unseal the search warrant that allowed the FBI to search his apartment and truck several days after the bombing .
