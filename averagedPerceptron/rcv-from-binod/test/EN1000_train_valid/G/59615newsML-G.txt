Britain &apos;s leading Roman Catholic cardinal complained on Tuesday that the country was obsessed by sex and said the Church could relax its centuries-old insistence on the celibacy of priests . 
cardinal Basil Hume , reacting to the resignation of a Scottish bishop linked with a divorcee , said the Catholic church was losing many excellent candidates for the priesthood because they wanted to be free to marry . 
&quot; It is not divine law . 
it is Church law , so any Pope or General Council could change it , &quot; he told BBC Radio . 
Hume , head of the Church in England and Wales , said society had become obsessed with the pleasures of the flesh . 
&quot; We are peddling unreal fantasies about what it is to be human . 
&quot; Our society is very preoccupied with sex . 
it is not a bad thing to have people who can witness to love without sex . 
Pope John Paul is implacably imposed to any change in Church law . 
the Vatican insists on celibacy from its priests and nuns , saying the Church &apos;s consecrated members must be celibate in order to devote themselves completely to God and their work . 
the Catholic Church was attracting an increasing number of new priests worldwide but Hume admitted : &quot; We are also losing excellent and very good people because they would wish to be married priests . 
Hume hinted that married priests had a role to play . 
&quot; Obviously a man who has been married , a married priest , brings a very special experience to their ministry , such as in the Anglican communion and the orthodox churches . 
Hume &apos;s stance was in sharp contrast to the unbending line taken by the Archbishop of Glasgow , Cardinal Thomas Winning , after the resignation of the Bishop of Argyll , Roderick Wright . 
he said Wright , who disappeared from his home last weekend at the same time as divorcee Kathleen Macphee , had been guilty of a major lapse . 
&quot; If we don &apos;t set high ideals and standards , we &apos;re not much of a Church , &quot; he said . 
if a bishop had admitted an affair or it were proven , the Vatican would probably &quot; urgently request &quot; him to resign under Church canon ( law ) 401 , which applies when a priest is unable to fulfil his office due to health or &quot; another serious reason . 
the human side of the dilemma was highlighted by Dr Michael Winter , a former Catholic priest who is now married . 
calling celibacy unnatural , he said : &quot; It leads to some awful human disasters because some who want to be priests aren &apos;t called to celibacy but try to put up with it and , after years and years of emotional repression , very often their personality breaks down in various ways . 
it can be quite tragic .
