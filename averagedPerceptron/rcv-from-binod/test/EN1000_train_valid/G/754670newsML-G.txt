new French Defence Minister Alain Richard said on Thursday he would scrap a controversial plan to call up young people for five days to assess their suitability for the military and lecture them on patriotism . 
Richard told the newspaper Le Monde he would instead propose to parliament that all French youths , including young women , be called up for a single Saturday before their 18th birthday to be lectured on defence issues . 
the proposals follow President Jacques Chirac &apos;s decision last year to start phasing out compulsory national service and transform the armed forces into all-professional units by 2002 . 
the five-day plan was a brainchild of past centre-right Defence Minister Charles Millon who wanted to keep a link between the armed forces and the public at large . 
the Socialist administration which took over after a June 1 general election , and of which Richard is a member , believes the five-day plan was a waste of money . 
the Socialists initially wanted to scrap the call-up altogether . 
the decision to maintain a single day programme was believed to have been made at the request of the military who , after initially opposing all such projects , began to see them as useful opportunities to interest youths in military careers . 
Richard said the new programme would also allow those youths who wanted to do so to undergo several weeks basic military training and then join reserve units . 
conscription has existed in France off-and-on since the French Revolution more than 200 years ago .
