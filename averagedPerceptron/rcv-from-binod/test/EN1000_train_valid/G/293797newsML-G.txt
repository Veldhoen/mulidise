Georgia Gov. 
Zell Miller has proposed moving up the start date by six months for a plan to limit welfare benefits to four years , the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said Wednesday . 
the changes were due to take effect at the beginning of fiscal 1998 on July 1 . 
Miller &apos;s proposal would retroactively move up the start date to Jan . 1 . 
the governor said the changes were urgently needed to &quot; change a ( welfare ) spending system that has been on autopilot for too long . 
Miller also proposed a $ 12 million reserve fund to make sure welfare payments are covered if applications increase during economic downturns . 
lawmakers will debate the proposals over the next few weeks as part of the supplemental budget allocations .
