United Utilities chairman Sir Desmond pitcher will announce a series of new appointments to the board of the privatised water and electricity group on Thursday .

engineering group Bullough has released its first half results , including a doubling of pre-exceptional profits to 8.36m stg after the sale or closure of 11 businesses . 
pre-tax profits at Bullough increased to 11m stg , buoyed by a 460,000 stg profit made at its refrigeration division against a loss of 1.6m the year before . 
Bullough chairman Sir Michael Pickard announced the results marked an end to the company &apos;s streamlining efforts , as it now has &apos; a much better balance of businesses &apos; . 
fears are mounting over the possibility UK interest rates may rise to seven per cent , as it was revealed on Wednesday that high street sales grew by an annual rate of 5.4 per cent in June . 
the high spending has been blamed on windfall-related activities and the announcement sent sterling to its highest level against the Mark since 1989 . 
economists are worried the figure will hurt exporters and heighten the &apos; policy dilemma &apos; being faced by the Bank of England . 
sales of household goods in Britain in June reached a record level , as official data indicated an extra 150m stg spent in the sector , or a rise of 7.5 per cent . 
carpet retailers experienced the biggest gains , at 30 per cent from last June and were followed by electrical goods sales , which rose 28 per cent , furniture which was up 24 per cent and DIY sales , which increased 10 per cent . 
economists predict improved weather will lead to stronger high street spending for July . 
Ramco Energy has made a 54m stg bid for rival exploration company JKX Oil &amp; Gas , a bid of 46p per share . 
the bid for JKX , which is chaired by Sir Robert Horton , is significantly less than the 190p per share level JKX reached when it was floated in 1995 and the one pound stg value estimated by NatWest Securities . 
JKX has struggled in recent years despite owning a major stake in large Ukraine oil and gasfields , as its customers in the former Soviet republic have failed to pay for the gas it produced . 
following its victory in the Eurovision Song Contest this year , Britain is now in the process of selecting candidates to host the show for 1998 .

NEC has supplied the contest organisers with a list of potential sites for outside broadcasts amid rumours the BBC has &apos; made it quite clear &apos; NEC &apos;s National Exhibition Centre would suit the event . 
due to sterling &apos;s strength on the foreign market , business leaders in London have warned exporters may be facing the leanest summer since 1992 . 
the British Chamber of Commerce warned the 35 per cent rise of sterling over the year will &apos; cause significant damage to the UK &apos;s international competitiveness &apos; , a statement which was backed by a BCC survey showing the level of foreign orders with UK firms has fallen to its lowest in five years . 
Reuters has emerged as one of the harder-hit companies as a result of sterling &apos;s recent surge in strength , as its sales for the first half of the year were down two per cent to 1,409m stg and pre-tax profits fell three per cent to 333m stg . 
since the first half of 1996 , it is estimated the strength of the pound has cost Reuters 50m stg in earnings . 
if the currency effects is ignored , however , sales at the company were promising , as they rose eight per cent and profits increased 12 per cent .

leading the list for Boc &apos;s major acquisition are Germany &apos;s Messerheim-Griesheim and Sweden &apos;s Aga , Europe &apos;s second and fourth largest industrial gas groups , respectively . 
in a further move towards the creation of an enhanced , or &apos; super &apos; Securities and Investments Board in the UK , the government has transferred insurance regulation to Economic Secretary Helen Liddell of the Treasury .

the regulation of the banking industry is expected to be transferred to the new SIB after the summer recess at the Treasury . 
according to Biocompatibles &apos; finance director Julian Steadman , talks were prolonged after J &amp; J requested to extend the deal to include Biocompatibles &apos; newly acquired range of modern stents .
