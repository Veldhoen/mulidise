Britain &apos;s opposition Labour Party will receive the 500,000 pounds outstanding from the one million pounds which businessman Matthew Harding pledged to the party before he died , his widow said on Saturday . 
Harding , vice-chairman of Chelsea Football Club , was killed in a helicopter crash last October a few months after making the high-profile pledge to Labour . 
&quot; Matthew was a passionate supporter of the Labour Party and a huge fan of Tony Blair , &quot; said his widow Ruth in a statement . 
&quot; Although there was no provision in his will for the money to be paid to the Labour Party , I know it is what he would have wanted . 
&quot; I am pleased we have been able to sort this out and I hope the money will help the Labour Party to fight and win the next election , &quot; she added . 
Britain must hold a general election by May 22 .
