visitors to Bodoland in northeast Indian state of Assam where a train blast killed dozens of people earlier this week are soon made aware that death is never far away in a region torn by tribal insurgency . 
&quot; If you go this way you are 100 percent risking your life , &quot; the leader of a police patrol on the Assam-West Bengal border told Reuters on Thursday . 
the road led towards Kokrajhar , the main town close to where guerrillas blasted a train on Monday , killing at least 33 people . 
&quot; They will put a tree across the road , you will be killed even before you try to move it . 
you won &apos;t get a chance to explain you are a journalist , you will just be killed &quot; . 
welcome to Bodoland -- the scene of vicious tribal unrest that Assam police sources unofficially estimate has cost around 5,000 lives in the last nine years . 
Assam has been designated a &quot; conflict zone &quot; since 1990 , giving the security forces sweeping powers to combat the guerrillas -- the extremist fringe of tribal political groups fighting for a homeland . 
the Bodos , who account for 800,000 of Assam &apos;s 25 million population , have a range of grievances but fundamentally they distrust the Assamese ability to govern the state . 
they are also angry that non-Bodos have been allowed to settle in their traditional tribal lands and that illegal logging on massive scale has devastated their forest-dwelling environment . 
two hours later , this time taking the safer , less direct , main highway towards Kokrajhar , a local resident advises : &quot; Don &apos;t go tonight , it is too dangerous . 
travel in the morning . 
the road to the remote town in western Assam which is a hotbed of guerrilla activity , is flanked by tea estates , paddy fields and forested areas where militants hide out . 
in the town political slogans daubed in red paint are visible everywhere -- on store fronts , the primitive walls of official buildings and on parked buses . 
&quot; Do for Bodo , Die for Bodo - BLT , &quot; is one common example , &quot; BLT is the blood and backbone of Bodoland , &quot; is another . 
BLT or BLTF is the Bodoland Liberation Tigers Force , the main guerrilla outfit south of Highway 31 -- the main road linking the isolated northeast states with the rest of India . 
most of the BLTF recruits come from the impoverished malaria-infested villages in the countryside around Kokrajhar . 
a police patrol in the town insists on providing an armed escort to the Hotel Indus , while a manager the next day imparts the chilling advice : &quot; Strange things happen here . 
like killing people . 
that is why no one goes out after dusk . 
recent Bodo-related violence , until the train blast , has been largely linked to inter-factional rivalry between the BTLF and the self-styled Bodoland Army ( formerly called Bodo Security Force ) . 
the Bodoland Army operates largely north of Highway 31 , up to the Himalayan foothills bordering the mountain kingdom of Bhutan . 
aside from killing each other , they murder members of tribal political parties which many believe sponsor the insurgents . 
&quot; They kill them in the market place and in their party offices , &quot; said one Kokrajhar woman . 
&quot; I know boys who are probably members of the BLTF , &quot; she said , &quot; Most of the boys have gone underground since the train bomb . 
police roadblocks on Thursday checked travellers on the road out of Kokrajhar towards Assam &apos;s main city Guwahati . 
the route was also punctuated by two partially blown bridges .
