the former guerrilla commander who is widely expected to win Chechnya &apos;s presidential election vowed on Sunday to turn Russia &apos;s rebel region into an internationally-recognised sovereign state . 
Aslan Maskhadov , speaking in the Chechen capital on the eve of the election , also said that as president he would seek &quot; war reparations &quot; from Russia to compensate for the devastation of the region caused by 21 months of fighting . 
he dismissed fears of an &quot; Afghan or Tajik scenario &quot; , of civil war as a product of the rhetoric of hardline rivals such as Shamil Basayev . 
victory for Basayev , who once led a bloody raid on a south Russian town , could fulfil Moscow &apos;s worst nightmares . 
Maskhadov is one of 16 candidates who have been running for president , although he and only three others appear to have any chance of victory . 
the others are Basayev , acting President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev and rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov . 
Itar-Tass news agency said three minor candidates had pulled out , but the report could not immediately be confirmed . 
Maskhadov , 45 , said Moscow seemed in no mood to negotiate on giving Chechnya &apos;s de facto independence more legal substance . 
&quot; The whole world , including Russia , will have to recognise that the elections are democratic and to recognise the legitimate authority of this popularly elected president and sit down at the negotiating table right away , &quot; he told reporters . 
&quot; We want to be recognised as a sovereign state . 
in Moscow , a deputy foreign minister underlined Kremlin sensitivity over the issue of sovereignty . 
Viktor Posuvalyuk said Russia was ready to break off relations with any country which granted Chechnya diplomatic recognition . 
&quot; We have warned the entire international community , &quot; he said , but acknowledged there were no signs yet of any country making a move to do so . 
President Boris Yeltsin sent troops into Chechnya in 1994 to prevent it seceding . 
Maskhadov &apos;s fighters humiliated them . 
but Moscow , worried about security and fearing a spread of separatism to other ethnic groups , still wants to stop the small but sensitive frontier region from formally breaking away . 
for Yeltsin , recovering from heart surgery and pneumonia , the mere holding of the elections constitutes a defeat . 
but few countries would entertain the notion of sacrificing relations with Russia in order to grant recognition to a region with a prewar population of one million people . 
Maskhadov said he believed some Russian forces might try to disrupt the election and that he hoped to secure the 50 percent of the vote needed on Monday to avoid a run-off in two weeks . 
more than 100 outside observers , including Russians , were in the north Caucasus region to see the vote is fair . 
the Chechen authorities have laid on tight security for foreign observers and journalists . 
the chief European mediator in Chechnya , Swiss diplomat Tim Guldimann , told Reuters the 75 monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe would have armed Chechen escorts , helicopter cover and be in constant radio contact . 
&quot; I don &apos;t see any problems with these elections from the security point of view , &quot; he said . 
Chechnya is awash with guns , however , and the increasingly bellicose rhetoric of the election campaign has kindled fears that it could descend into factional fighting . 
Basayev is popular among the young and espouses a fervent brand of Islamic rule . 
he could force a run-off , as might Yandarbiyev , who became the rebels &apos; leader when Dzhokhar Dudayev was killed last April . 
Udugov also has solid support . 
in their first internationally monitored elections , Chechens will also choose from among some 850 candidates standing for 63 seats in a new regional assembly . 
results are expected to start coming in on Tuesday .
