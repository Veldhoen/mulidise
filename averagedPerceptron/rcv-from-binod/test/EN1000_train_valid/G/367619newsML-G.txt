Diana , Princess of Wales , has used an emotional and hard-hitting television documentary about her trip to Angola to publicise her horror at the way landmines have torn apart the lives of mothers and children . 
issuing a heartfelt plea for an immediate worldwide ban on anti-personnel mines , the princess tells in her own words how advance briefings had left her totally unprepared for the shock of what she saw when she arrived in Angola last month . 
in a British Broadcasting Corporation film to be shown on Tuesday the princess is shown close to tears as she visits children in hospital after they have been blown up by the mines that litter Angola in their millions after years of war . 
&quot; Here people are living with the knowledge that it is only a matter of time before someone else is maimed or killed . 
&quot; It was moving and encouraging to see the confidence shown by those learning to walk again . 
but the millions of unexploded landmines in their country will go on shattering lives for decades to come . 
since her divorce last year from royal heir Prince Charles , the princess has been trying to cast herself in a new mould . 
she wants people to see her as a caring humanitarian rather than just a glamorous clothes horse . 
at one point she declares that she is &quot; more comfortable at this end of the market &quot; . 
during her four-day visit to Angola , the princess was told by officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross that she would not be shown a sanitised version of events . 
clad in cotton trousers and a sleeveless shirt instead of her trademark designer finery , the princess is shown visiting children being fitted with artificial limbs and being treated in hospital for terrible wounds inflicted by landmines . 
she donned a blast-proof face shield and flak jacket to visit a minefield being cleared by members of Britain &apos;s halo Trust anti-mine charity . 
blowing up a mine by remote control , she said : &quot; One down , 10 million to go . 
&quot; And in a hospital a visibly affected princess sat at the bedside of a little girl whose intestines had been blown out by a mine . 
&quot; When you see little children like that in that situation it just beings it all to the surface , &quot; Diana said . 
it &apos;s very traumatic as a mother to witness this . 
she added : &quot; If these children are to have a future we must end the use of these evil weapons . 
the only way forward is for a total worldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines . 
the documentary also showed that a widely-publicised political row in Britain , when the princess &apos;s anti-mine remarks were seen as breaking a taboo against royalty mixing in politics , had distressed her . 
&quot; I think I &apos;m going to burst into tears now , &quot; she said after learning that her humanitarian efforts in Angola were being turned into a political football at home . 
an unnamed government minister was quoted as saying the princess was a &quot; loose cannon &quot; , forcing her to respond that she was &quot; just trying to help &quot; mine victims . 
Angola clearly had a sobering effect on the high-society princess , who used her documentary to declare : 
&quot; People always say that the eyes mirror the soul . 
during the last few days I &apos;ve seen a lot of anguish and a lot of hope in the eyes of people I &apos;ve met .
