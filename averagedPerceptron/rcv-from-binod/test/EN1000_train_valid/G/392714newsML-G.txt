the Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate committee investigating allegations of questionable campaign fund-raising has himself received backing from a controversial Kansas City businessman , the Los Angeles Times reported on Thursday . 
the newspaper said Farhad Azima , a registered Republican whose companies have had run-ins with regulators from the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Aviation Administration , is a former law client , business associate , personal friend and political supporter of Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee . 
Thompson , the tough-guy actor in such films as &quot; The Hunt for Red October &quot; and &quot; In the Line of Fire , &quot; chartered a jet from Azima during his 1996 campaign , and Azima was one donor among thousands who contributed $ 5 million toward his re-election . 
the Los Angeles paper said Thompson received more than $ 1 million from political action committees , particularly from pharmaceutical , tobacco and chemical interests . 
Thompson also received donations totalling about $ 24,000 from U.S. subsidiaries of British firms . 
&quot; Such contributions are permitted but became controversial late in the 1996 election campaign as attention focused on the Democrats &apos; foreign-linked money , &quot; the report said . 
Thompson &apos;s 1994 campaign for the last two years of Vice President Al Gore &apos;s former Senate seat received $ 177,000 from the National Rifle Association , among the largest sums spent on behalf of any candidate by a single interest group in that election cycle , the paper said , quoting the Centre for responsive Politics , a nonpartisan research group . 
according to the report , Thompson and Azima have been friends since 1983 , when the Iranian-born Azima bought a controlling interest in a Smyrna , Tennessee , airline company on whose board Thompson served . 
Azima and other members of his family contributed $ 3,000 to Thompson &apos;s 1996 campaign at a fund-raising dinner the businessman staged at his Missouri home . 
the event brought in $ 9,500 , said Thompson aides , who added that Azima also leased his jet to the Tennessean &apos;s campaign twice . 
but Tom Daffron , Thompson &apos; Senate chief of staff , characterised Azima &apos;s relationship with the senator as &quot; intermittent &quot; and played down Azima &apos;s impact on the Senate campaign , the paper reported . 
Azima , who attended three of the controversial coffees at the Clinton White House , was a major contributor to the Democrats , according to the paper . 
he arranged a Kansas City fund-raiser that netted the Democrats $ 250,000 shortly before the election . 
he also was a frequent White House visitor during the Reagan and Bush presidencies , the paper reported . 
one of Azima &apos;s firms , buffalo Airways of Waco , Texas , is fighting a Justice Department lawsuit over a disputed million-dollar bill for fuel used to ship medical supplies for the Pentagon during the Gulf War . 
the same company faced an IRS LIEN on payroll taxes until the matter was settled recently , according to Azima &apos;s attorney , Jeffrey S. Fried . 
one of Azima &apos;s jets was allegedly used to smuggle arms to Iran during the Iran-Contra scandal of the Reagan administration , but the paper quoted Fried as saying Azima had 50 jets on lease at the time and that he had no knowledge of such a flight , if there was one .
