Malaysia said on Wednesday it was freezing ties with Singapore , including awarding new contracts to Singapore firms , over unkind remarks made by elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew about a Malaysian state . 
the decision was made at a cabinet meeting chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim , the national news agency Bernama said , quoting several cabinet ministers whom it did not name . 
one minister , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the Cabinet decided to cool off ties for a while in terms of bilateral talks &quot; or anything to do with Singapore &quot; . 
any ongoing bilateral talks will also be postponed for now , he said . 
Bernama quoted another minister as saying awarding of contracts to Singapore companies , government-to-government contacts and meetings between ruling political parties would also be affected . 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is currently on a four-day official visit to Japan . 
foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi is accompanying him . 
no Singapore government official was immediately available for comment . 
Bernama quoted a minister as saying the decision was prompted by remarks from Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar after Malaysia last week announced it had accepted Lee &apos;s &quot; unreserved apology &quot; for describing Johor state as &quot; notorious for shootings , muggings and car-jackings &quot; . 
Badawi said after last week &apos;s cabinet meeting the government accepted the apology but the episode had deeply hurt all Malaysians and &quot; restoration of the old level of relationship would take time . 
radio Corporation of Singapore reported the same day that Jayakumar expressed surprise at Badawi &apos;s statement . 
earlier this week , Malaysia newspapers quoted Goh as telling Radio Corporation the differences between the two countries were mainly due to inaccurate newspaper reports . 
the latest fuss between two neighbours , who share the same colonial legacy and were briefly united between 1963 and 1965 , appeared to have died down after Lee &apos;s apology and his move to withdraw the offending remarks from a court affidavit . 
it was a rare public apology by the 73-year-old Lee , who led the fight for Singapore &apos;s independence and was its prime minister from 1959 until 1990 . 
but his bitter debates with Malaysian leaders over &quot; special rights &quot; for ethnic Malays led to Singapore &apos;s expulsion from the Malaysia Federation in 1965 , leaving wounds that linger today . 
last year , Lee hit a raw nerve when he said some day Singapore might be forced to re-unite with Malaysia if the island state was unable to compete on its own . 
but it would only do so if Malaysia adopted meritocratic policies . 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed , infuriated by the reference to meritocracy , accused Lee of conjuring up Malaysia as a &quot; bogeyman &quot; to scare voters ahead of Singapore elections that were eventually held in January . 
Malaysians said they were not altogether happy with Lee &apos;s apology and retraction , which were done by issuing statements through his press secretary . 
Lee , himself has not personally commented about the incident . 
Lee &apos;s controversial remarks were part of an affidavit he made in court on January 27 in his libel suit against opposition politician Tang Liang Hong . 
Tang fled to Johor Baru , capital of Johor state , immediately after losing a race for parliament in Singapore &apos;s general elections on January 2 , saying he had received death threats in Singapore . 
Lee questioned why he would feel safer in Johor .
