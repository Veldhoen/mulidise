the Indian government on Wednesday launched a tax amnesty scheme to take in more revenues and combat black money , but said collectors would crack down on tax dodgers after the plan closes in six months . 
officials said the Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme ( VDIS ) , which had been broadly outlined in the 1997 / 98 ( April-March ) budget presented on February 28 , would begin on July 1 and end on December 31 . 
the six-month scheme aims to draw tax evaders who operate in the shadows of the &quot; parallel economy &quot; into the tax net . 
private economists say at least four of every 10 rupees earned in India are generated in the black economy and are never declared to authorities . 
Ravi Kant , chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) , told a news conference : &quot; We want 100 percent integration of the parallel economy with the mainstream . 
but he refused to put a figure on the size of the black economy . 
&quot; We do not want to hazard a guess , &quot; he said . 
the scheme offers tax evaders , even those under investigation under the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act ( FERA ) , the opportunity to come clean without penalty . 
&quot; It is something very difficult to understand . 
what will happen to people who have been detained under FERA and not proven guilty ? 
&quot; V. Raghuraman , secretary general of Associated Chambers of Commerce ( Assocham ) , told Reuters . 
the Finance Ministry has launched a media blitz to highlight the scheme and hired a private public relations firm . 
in the budget he presented to parliament in February , Finance Minister P. Chidambaram slashed the tax rate for the highest personal income bracket to 30 percent from 40 , and the corporate tax rate to 35 percent from 40 in the 1997 / 98 budget . 
&quot; The government needs to get 300 to 400 billion rupees ( $ 8.4 billion to $ 11 billion ) to come in through this scheme or else it would serve no purpose , &quot; Raghuraman said . 
officials cautioned that VDIS offered the last chance for tax evaders to come clean . 
&quot; We do not really expect the need for these schemes in the future , &quot; Kant said . 
of the money raised through the scheme , 77.5 percent will go to the states and the balance will remain with the federal government . 
the money will be used to develop infrastructure , as well as health and education projects throughout the country .
