the World Bank said on Tuesday it had delayed a meeting on a $ 30 million loan to Croatia at the request of the United States . 
U.S. officials said on Monday the U.S. requested the delay because Zagreb has not followed through on Dayton peace accord commitments . 
&quot; We intend to send concrete signals on a weekly and monthly basis , &quot; the official said . 
&quot; Right now , in our view , they need to receive a signal that they haven &apos;t continued the path toward progress , &quot; he added , referring to pledges on suspected war criminals . 
Croatia extradited its first war crimes suspect to the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague in April , days after the West tightened pressure on the former Yugoslav republic . 
but the U.S. official said there had been no real movement since then . 
the executive board of the World Bank had originally been due to discuss the loan , designed to help improve the functioning of Croatia &apos;s banks and financial institutions , on Tuesday morning . 
the World Bank &apos;s information office did not know when the loan would be put back on the agenda .
