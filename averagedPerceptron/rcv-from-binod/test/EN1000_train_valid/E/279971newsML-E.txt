starting with this release , the Conference Board has revamped the index of leading , lagging and coincident indicators in an attempt to provide better defined warnings of turning points and fewer false signals . 
the revamped report includes the following changes : 
-- Treasury Yield curve , an index of 10-year Treasury bond rates less the federal funds rate , replaces two former categories of unfilled Orders and Sensitive Materials Prices . 
-- New orders for capital goods outside the defense industry replaces the former Contracts and Orders for Plant and Equipment . 
-- initial jobless Claims now includes Puerto Rico and other U.S. 
the board said that beginning with the next report on the index of leading economic indicators , due out February 4 , it will issue the index at 1000 hrs est ( 1500 GMT ) instead of at 0830 hrs .
