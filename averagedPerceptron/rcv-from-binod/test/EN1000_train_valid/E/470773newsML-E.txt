Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Wednesday the local inflation outlook remained the key to monetary policy . 
&quot; The inflation rate , which is the target of the government and the Reserve Bank ( of Australia ) by agreement is set at two to three percent , we are well within that band and that will be the key determinator of monetary policy in accordance with the arrangements set between the government and the bank , &quot; Costello told parliament . 
&quot; We see a continuing low inflation , low interest rate environment , strengthening business expectations , consistent with good growth in 1997 and real opportunities for small business and other businesses alike . 
in the year to December , Australia &apos;s underlying inflation rose 2.1 percent , while headline inflation rose 1.5 percent . 
Costello &apos;s comments followed the United States Federal Reserve &apos;s decision on Tuesday to raise interest rates for the first time in two years . 
the U.S. central bank lifted rates by 25 basis points to 5.50 percent .
