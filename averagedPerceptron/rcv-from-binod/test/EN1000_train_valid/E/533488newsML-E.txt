British retail sales , a key indicator of consumer confidence , rose 0.3 percent in March , according to official figures released on Wednesday . 
retail sales in March rose 4.0 percent over March 1996 , compared with 4.3 percent in February . 
the data were in line with analysts &apos; expectations . 
economists said the retail sales data were unlikely to have any significant impact upon rate hike speculation . 
interest rates are currently at 6.0 percent and many economists expect them to be raised soon after the May 1 election . 
&quot; Still a firm set of numbers . 
if we look at the first quarter we &apos;ve got annualised growth in retail sales of around 3-3 / 4 percent -- that &apos;s fairly strong growth , &quot; said Adrian Owens , an analyst with Julius Baer Investments . 
analysts said the retail sales figures , coupled with falling inflation and unemployment data , pointed to a strong consumer sector . 
&quot; ( The consumer sector ) is only likely to get stronger through the year as we see building society pay-outs , house prices still strong and inflation coming down , boosting real incomes . 
these numbers are pretty much in line with expectations , &quot; said Adrian Schmit of Chase .
