Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Monday the United States must never default on its debt , adding that even a &quot; whiff &quot; of such an event would have serious repercussions for years to come . 
speaking to the Public Securities Association ( PSA ) here , Greenspan recounted the changes in the marketplace and government since the first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton was in office . 
&quot; It is inevitable that consideration of the budget be included as part of a wider debate on public policies , &quot; Greenspan said in his remarks . 
&quot; However Alexander Hamilton drew a line that no one should cross : the government of the United States must never default on its debt , &quot; Greenspan added . 
the Fed chief said even a &quot; whiff &quot; of the possibility that the United States would not honour its financial commitments &quot; would push up the cost of borrowing for years to come . 
last year , wranglings over the federal budget and a standoff on raising the debt ceiling prompted Moody &apos;s Investors Sevice Inc and IBCA to put a portion of the U.S. debt on review for possible downgrade . 
Moody &apos;s is one of the largest U.S. credit rating agencies , and IBCA is the European credit rating agency . 
standard and Poor &apos;s , the other major U.S. credit agency , kept close tabs on the budget and debt ceiling situations , but never actually put any U.S. debt on review . 
Greenspan said policymakers at the Federal Reserve will do their part &quot; to contribute to financial stability , which is to preserve the purchasing power of money over time . 
the Fed Chairman received the PSA &apos;s 1996 Distinguished Public Service Award at its annual awards dinner here . 
the award is given to recognise the accomplishments of individuals who have had significant impact on the public securities business at the federal , state and local level .
