Ministers from 128 nations put the world on track on Friday towards free trade in the 21st century with a series of ground-breaking agreements they said would unshackle global business and help the poor . 
&quot; In pursuit of the goal of sustainable growth and development for the common good , we envisage a world where trade flows freely , &quot; said the final declaration by ministers from 128 member countries attending the inaugural conference of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) . 
Ministers hailed a pact to scrap tariffs on information technology by the end of the century as a triumph for the meeting that showed the fledgling trade body had emerged as a powerful new actor on the world economic stage . 
some developing nations attacked a lack of transparency but appeared to agree that a step forward had been achieved -- if not the leap for which they had hoped . 
but aid agencies charged that the WTO was a &quot; rich men &apos;s club &quot; . 
an eleventh-hour agreement to boost the world &apos;s 48 poorest countries ensured passage of a final declaration that also set the agenda for discussion of new issues such as cross-border investment , competition and the murky realm of government procurement . 
&quot; The ministerial conference has been an outstanding event in all respects , &quot; Singapore &apos;s trade minister and conference chairman Yeo Cheow Tong said to applause from fellow ministers . 
the eight-page declaration forms a blueprint for the future agenda of the WTO and endorses a ground-breaking Information Technology Agreement ( ITA ) to eliminate tariffs on the rapidly growing $ 600 billion world market in computer-related products . 
&quot; I regard it as astonishing that we &apos;ve been able to bring together such a diverse group of countries and get agreement on a text that is not just papering over the cracks but genuinely important , &quot; said European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan . 
the meeting had boosted the strength and profile of the trade body , Brittan said . 
analysts said the declaration , adopted by consensus in line with WTO procedures , gave genuine hope of advances towards global free trade in the next century . 
&quot; This week has marked a real step forward for the multilateral trading system , &quot; said a delighted WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero . 
the outcome could affect the poorest &quot; man in the street &quot; , said Ruggiero . 
economists said the ITA would spur the information technology industry , especially in Asia , and eventually lead to lower prices for a vast range of consumer goods that use electronic parts . 
&quot; The ITA is the cars and trucks on the road , but telecoms is the road , &quot; Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told a news conference , giving a hint of future tussles facing the world trade body before ministers meet again in 1998 . 
Barshefky said 28 countries , representing 84 percent of global trade in information technology products , had already signed the agreement and another six were committed to signing , thus bringing total coverage to more than 90 percent . 
delegates said the triumph of clinching an IT pact would have been tarnished without agreement on the conference &apos;s other main agenda item -- the link between trade and labour standards . 
a hard-fought compromise contained just enough to enable North and South to proclaim victory . 
developing nations , led by India , Pakistan and Egypt , had refused to countenance any interference by the WTO in the area of workers &apos; rights , fearing it would undermine their chief comparative advantage in world trade -- cheap labour . 
Washington and a string of European countries were equally adamant on action to help 250 million child workers , mainly in the Third World , and to improve sweatshop conditions . 
the final declaration satisfied poor countries because it firmly rejected the use of labour standards for protectionist purposes and said the International Labour Organisation , based like the WTO in Geneva , is the competent body to deal with them . 
&quot; I think that the agreement on labour standards does mark a breakthrough ... on this delicate but vital subject , &quot; Brittan said . 
&quot; We have put our foot in the door . 
in New Delhi , irate legislators demanding an explanation of what they saw as a government climbdown forced an abrupt adjournment of parliament .
