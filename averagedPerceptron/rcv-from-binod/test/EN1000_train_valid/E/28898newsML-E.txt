U.S. seasonally adjusted retail sales rose 0.8 percent in the four weeks of fiscal August versus July , according to the Lynch , Jones &amp; Ryan Inc Redbook retail sales index . 
the index rose 6.7 percent when compared with the same month a year ago , the report said . 
adjusted retail sales also rose 6.3 percent in the week ended August 31 compared with the same week a year ago , it said . 
while sales for the month were revised down from preliminary estimates , August results were close to retailers &apos; targets , said Jay Meltzer , managing director of Redbook Research . 
&quot; We began the month with slightly more upbeat plans than materialized , but now that the month is history it was certainly alright , &quot; Meltzer said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television . 
many retailers undershot their initial targets for August , but only narrowly , Meltzer said . 
Back-to-school items again drove sales last week , he said . 
&quot; Back-to-school is clearly better this year than last year , &quot; Meltzer said . 
sales projections for the coming weeks look &quot; moderately bright , &quot; he added . 
&quot; The good news is that ( stores &apos; ) inventories are under control , &quot; Meltzer said . 
&quot; That &apos;s a much better picture than it was at this time last year .
