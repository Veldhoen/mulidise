the Minister &apos;s 1997 / 98 Budget has been acclaimed as providing relief to the low and low-middle income earners . 
on this score and others the budget has been described as a people &apos;s budget . 
unfortunately the claim of providing relief to this class of income-tax payer is not altogether valid . 
on more careful examination the claim can only apply to a particularly small group of people with taxable income in 1996 / 97 lying between 23,000 rand to 28,000 rand . 
the Minister proposed to introduce a revised tax schedule for 1997 / 98 with one less bracket , but with the threshold tax of 45 percent sill applicable from 100,000 rand . 
the rebate , however , is to be increased form 2,660 rand to 3,215 rand . 
the Minister has shown in the Budget Review that there is an effective tax reduction for all incomes , but with the reduction fading in percentage terms as taxable incomes get higher . 
at 25,000 rand the tax reduction , or relief , is 18.7 percent , at 30,000 rand it is 15.5 percent , and at 60,000 rand it is 5.7 percent . 
at 100,000 rand the relief is a mere 2.2 percent . 
and so the Minister felt he was able to claim that the effects of inflation have been reduced for all taxpayers and eliminated for those with taxable income of less than 30,000 rand . 
furthermore he calculated that the new tax schedule will actually cost the government 2.8 billion rand in lost taxes and , to put it another way , it would put 2.8 billion rand into the pockets of families who need it . 
but we should not be taken in with this sophistry . 
in the total situation the Budget Review shows that there would have been an increase of 15.7 percent in tax receipts from individuals , from 57.6 billion rand to 66.7 billion rand , had the 1996 / 97 tax schedule remained in place . 
however , with the introduction of the new schedule the increase is the said 2.8 billion rand less , representing an increase of now only 10.9 percent . 
generally , the taxpayers are paying less , but really only less than they would otherwise be paying . 
the sleight of hand which allows the Minister to makes his claims of relief arises from the calculations of tax being applied to the same unchanged level of income . 
for example , the new and old tax rates are both applied to a taxable income of 30,000 rand . 
this does not allow for the likely fact that the taxpayer will have received an increase in wage and therefore taxable income , which could take him into a higher tax bracket . 
indeed , the Minister has estimated the tax revenue for the new fiscal year on the assumption of an average wage increase of eleven percent . 
therefore , for example , the tax situation of the taxpayer with a taxable income of 30,000 rand in 1996 / 97 should be compared with his tax calculated with the new rates on a taxable income of 33,300 rand . 
if the percentage increase in tax due is equal to eleven percent then his position is neutral , but if it is greater than eleven percent he is worse off and has suffered a loss of income after tax in real terms . 
only if the tax payable increases by less than eleven percent can he be said to be better off as a result of the new tax schedule . 
the appropriate calculations are straight forward and these show that for 30,000 rand in 1996 / 97 , for example , the tax payable actually increases by 18.2 percent on the new rates . 
at 60,000 rand it is much better with the tax increase being but , 14.4 percent . 
at 100,000 rand it is 13.5 percent and at 150,000 rand it is 12.4 percent . 
at 20,000 rand , the tax payable is as much as an extra 19.4 percent . 
but from 24,000 rand to 27,000 rand the increase in tax payable is less than eleven percent , at between 7.8 percent and 9.9 percent . 
this is the only range of taxable income where it can be said that there is any degree of tax relief with the introduction of the new tax schedule . 
one can invoke a concept of tax accelerator defined as the ratio of the percentage increase in tax payable to any given percentage increase in taxable income . 
this can be applied along tax schedules or between tax schedules at different income levels . 
thus if the tax accelerator is at unity the position is neutral , but above unity there is fiscal drag . 
with the introduction of the new tax schedule the tax accelerator at 30,000 rand is 1.65 and at 60,000 rand it is 1.31 . 
as pointed out already , only from 24,000 rand to 27,000 rand is the tax accelerator less than unity , on which basis can there be any claim of tax relief . 
the Budget Review document shows that the largest segment of the tax paying population , that is 44 percent of the total , lies between taxable incomes of 30,000 rand to 60,000 rand . 
for this entire low-middle income earning group the tax accelerator is greater than unity - indeed the optimum level is at 55,000 rand in 1996 / 97 , for which the tax accelerator is 1.27 . 
on this basis the claim of providing tax relief to the lower tax earning class just cannot be supported .
