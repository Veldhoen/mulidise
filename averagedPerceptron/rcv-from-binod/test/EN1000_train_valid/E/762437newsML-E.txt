the Yugoslav government should implement urgent reforms to halt the grey economy of unregistered transactions if the country is to be reintegrated into world markets , analysts said on Tuesday . 
&quot; What we need are real and radical reforms and equal treatment of all the subjects on the market . 
we need the rule of law and an end of domination of politics over economics , &quot; Slobodan Milosavljevic of the Market Research Institute said . 
the government has clamped down on street vendors but the measures have bypassed their bosses . 
analysts said many state officials took a big slice of the grey economy &quot; cake &quot; , which according to some estimates accounted for around 40 percent of the country &apos;s gross domestic product ( GDP ) . 
&quot; Ad hoc measures like police raids on street sellers and flea markets have a short-term effect and do not tackle the main grey economy bosses , whose businesses are &apos; sacred &apos; , &quot; Milosavljevic told Reuters . 
the violent break-up of the former Balkan federation , a crippling oil and trade blockade , hyperinflation and the inflow of half a million refugees have ravaged the economy . 
a dramatic fall in GDP to half its pre-war 1991 level and a drop in living standards accompanied by a rapid rise in unemployment have pushed around three million people into poverty . 
in hyperinflationary 1993 most people lost a significant amount of money , while just a few managed to compensate for this and accumulate wealth by speculation , according to a Human Development Report by the Belgrade Economics Institute . 
growing poverty , a shortage of jobs and four years of isolation forced the government to approve illegal business and income , analysts said . 
the grey economy gave many disenchanted citizens the chance to fight for a livelihood and bolstered the ruling Socialists &apos; hold on power as it covered up growing social inequalities and helped preserve relative social peace , they said . 
&quot; But if the country is to be fully integrated into the world market and attract foreign investment , companies must perform according to the required world standards , &quot; said Danica Popovic , economist of the private CES-Mekon centre for economic studies . 
the government should provide stable economic conditions and gradually legalise and integrate the grey economy through a mix of short- and long-term measures , analysts said . 
&quot; This would narrow the grey zone to the acceptable level of some 25 percent of GDP , &quot; said Jurij Bajec , economist at the Economics Institute . 
the Institute estimates that the grey economy reached its peak in 1993 , with inflation surging to 60 percent a day , when it accounted for 54.4 percent of GDP or $ 5.7 billion . 
in 1994 it dropped back to 44.7 percent because of an economic recovery programme launched in January that year which halted hyperinflation , the Institute &apos;s Gorana Krstic said . 
in 1995 it accounted for some 40.8 percent of GDP with about one million out of a population of 10.5 million involved in black marketeering . 
&quot; The grey economy cost the state some $ 5 billion under 1992-96 sanctions , &quot; Krstic said , adding that the informal economy was likely to have stayed around the 1995 level or slipped a little last year .
