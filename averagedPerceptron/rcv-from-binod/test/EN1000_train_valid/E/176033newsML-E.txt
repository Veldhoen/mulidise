the Mexican government will seek a $ 5.0 billion limit on net foreign borrowing in 1997 , according to its budget proposal delivered to Congress on Thursday . 
&quot; With relation to external debt , the initiative proposes a limit to net external public sector debt in the national currency equal to $ 5.0 billion ( U.S. ) , &quot; the budget said . 
the increase in public debt will allow Mexican development banks to give a boost to exporters and allow investment spending by the National Electricity Commission and Petroleos Mexicanos to increase , the budget said . 
&quot; The federal government resorts to external debt mainly with the object of refinancing existing debts in better conditions , &quot; the budget said . 
&quot; As a consequence the external debt of the federal government will not vary significantly with respect to the end of 1996 . 
with respect to the internal debt , the public sector deficit will rise to 15.89 billion pesos or 0.5 percent of gross domestic product . 
the deficit will reflect a surplus of 18.348 billion pesos and a federal government deficit of 34.238 billion pesos , the government said . 
&quot; With these numbers , we are looking for ... a federal government net internal debt of 34.0 billion pesos , &quot; the budget proposal said .
