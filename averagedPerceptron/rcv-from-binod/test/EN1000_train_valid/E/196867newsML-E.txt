the Internal Revenue Service on Monday launched its annual training session for field agents who monitor tax-law compliance by issuers of municipal bonds , an IRS spokesman said . 
&quot; Yield burning , &quot; arbitrage and small-issue bonds will be the focus of the week-long session attended by 40 agents , the spokesman said . 
some bond lawyers said they would object if the yield burning part of the session focuses on settlement procedures the IRS set out in July on &quot; yield burning . 
under the IRS &apos; July plan , dubbed &quot; Revenue Procedure 96-41 , &quot; the Service will settle future yield burning charges with issuers who agree to pay the federal government the difference between the price they paid for Treasury securities and the spot price of the securities , plus interest . 
in September , IRS suspended the one-year settlement deadline spelled out in the revenue procedure , but did not revoke the rest of the notice . 
yield burning refers to to claims that underwriters of advanced refunding bonds overcharged issuers in the early 1990s for U.S. treasuries bought in the open market and used in bond refundings .
