Singapore &apos;s export growth , which rose unexpectedly in July , is likely to slip back into negative territory in August as a global downturn in the electronics industry persists , economists said on Wednesday . 
eight financial institutions predicted on average in a Reuters poll that August non-oil domestic exports would fall by 0.8 percent in nominal terms on a year-on-year basis . 
forecasts ranged widely from a drop of 4.5 percent to a rise of 3.5 percent in the poll conducted on September 17 . 
this compares with a 6.4 percent rise in July and a 6.1 percent fall in June . 
throughout last year and in the first half of 1996 , growth often reached double digits . 
&quot; electronics exports are going to drag the figures down again . 
last month &apos;s bounce is not particularly sustainable over the medium term , &quot; said Desmond supple , Southeast Asia economist at research firm I.D.E.A. 
electronics and related products accounted for almost half of Singapore &apos;s total industrial output and 60 percent of its non-oil exports in 1995 . 
economists also varied in their predictions of when the electronics industry , hit by a slowdown in high technology markets in the United States , might see a turnaround . 
Eddie Lee , regional economist at Vickers Ballas , was among the optimists . 
&quot; We are expecting the Christmas sales to boost demand and also the fall in prices &quot; of electronics products to boost demand in the fourth quarter , Lee said . 
Tay May Yuen , economist at Crosby Securities , agreed Christmas demand for personal computers and disc drives , coupled with increased production , would boost exports in the fourth quarter . 
but ng Bok Eng , regional economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell , said Singapore &apos;s export growth would , at best , make a modest recovery by the first quarter of 1997 . 
&quot; One of the reasons exports went up so significantly in July was the low base in the same period last year . 
that low base scenario will not happen again in August , &quot; he said . 
ng said the export slowdown would have a knock-on effect on other sectors of the economy , including financial services and transportation . 
at the other end of the spectrum , Daniel Lian , regional economist at NatWest Markets , said August non-oil exports were likely to rise 3.5 percent . 
external demand hasn &apos;t really slowed down that much , &quot; Lian said . 
but he said that if sagging exports in Indonesia , Malaysia and Thailand had severely dented demand for Singapore &apos;s products and services , it would result in a &quot; broad-based slowdown &quot; for the island-nation .
