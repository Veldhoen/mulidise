the city of Wheatland in northern California expects to default on November 1 on its bond payments , the city administrator said on Monday . 
&quot; It will be a default , &quot; said Wheatland Administrator clay Castleberry , who in August sent notices to bondholders warning of a possible default on the Mello-Roos bond payments . 
Wheatland &apos;s $ 2.1 million of Mello-Roos bonds were issued in 1990 to pay for sewer and highway improvements in areas planned for development of hundreds of new housing units . 
Castleberry said bond reserves were nearly depleted , and that the city did not have the funds to cover the shortfall and fully pay noteholders on November 1 . 
he said the development has been marred by financial problems due to delinquencies by major property owners . 
last November , Wheatland was forced to draw down on bond reserves to pay investors . 
the bond issue was the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry . 
but in late May , the SEC told the city it was dropping its probe . 
the SEC is still investigating the deal &apos;s underwriter , San Francisco-based First California Capital Markets Group Inc .
