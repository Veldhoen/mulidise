the province of Neuquen is set to become Argentina &apos;s second issuer of a bond backed by oil royalties , a senior provincial official said Thursday . 
the province is planning to launch a $ 63 million bond due March 2001 . 
it will be guaranteed by the oil and gas royalties paid by oil company YPF to the province for its concession in the Loma de la Lata field , a Neuquen local government official who did not want to be named told Reuters . 
Neuquen &apos;s concession system guarantees the province 12 percent of monthly production by concession holders . 
the bond will carry a &quot; subsidiary guarantee , &quot; from revenues generated by tax income shared with the central government . 
according to the official , the bond , which will only be issued locally , will be priced 400 basis points over 180-day Libor . 
it will carry a coupon of 9.75 percent and most likely be issued next month . 
the bond will be used in part to pay off a $ 43 million loan to the province by Banco Rio de la Plata . 
the official said the combined guarantees of the bond are likely to fetch it a very high credit rating . 
in July , Banco Rio de la Plata underwrote Argentina &apos;s first oil-backed bond -- a $ 150 million debenture due 2002 issued by the province of Mendoza and collateralized with royalties from five oil concessions in the province . 
the official said , &quot; Banco Rio is interested in underwriting this bond as well .
