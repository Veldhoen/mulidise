Russia &apos;s Komi Republic , which said in June it was working on an international credit rating , might not seem an obvious candidate to tap foreign capital markets for funds . 
a sparsely-populated former penal colony in northwestern Russia stretching past the Arctic circle , Komi has just 1.2 million people inhabiting 161,000 square miles of dense fir and birch forests . 
like many of the 89 regions that make up the vast Russian Federation , it rarely enters Russia &apos;s political spotlight . 
but that is no obstacle to issuing a Eurobond in the minds of some Komi officials . 
they view recent successful issues by Moscow and St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod &apos;s forthcoming launch , as a sign of how successful Komi &apos;s could be . 
&quot; We supply St. Petersburg with oil and coal . 
I mean it just as an example -- why can they do it , and we can &apos;t ? 
I consider that we have enough reason ( to do it ) , &quot; said Komi Finance Minister Alexander Zakharov . 
that approach is representative of a long list of far-flung regions , desperate for cheap credit , that have announced Eurobond plans in past months . 
Russia &apos;s headlong economic reforms have left many regions , often heavily , if not exclusively , dependent on a single industry , reeling under the burden of spiraling production costs and a web of debt . 
huge delays in wage and pension payments and strikes in some sectors have led many regional governors to condemn the federal government &apos;s strict monetary policies and complain that Moscow is insensitive to regional problems . 
but some , inspired by the example of the central government , which only recently placed a third , $ 2 billion issue , see a Eurobond as an extension of efforts to attract foreign investment for structural reforms and production projects . 
untapped until Soviet dictator Josef Stalin &apos;s repression sent thousands of prisoners to forced labour camps in the 1930s and 1940s , Komi &apos;s wealth of natural resources is now drawing foreign investors hungry for profits . 
recently , Western firms such as Britain &apos;s BG plc and Centrica , and Swiss Glencore International AG have rushed to form joint ventures with local oil company Komineft and its recently-formed parent company KomiTEK . 
Viktor Veltsovsky , 
head of Komi &apos;s department of foreign and regional relations , said Western investment was $ 59 million in 1996 , up 60 percent from 1995 . 
he forecast $ 100 million in 1997 . 
he said the figure included a German credit deal backed by exports to finance various oil and wood processing projects . 
&quot; For us the ideal situation would be when we could attract a billion dollars a year -- but there &apos;s a big difference between $ 100 million and $ 1 billion , &quot; he said . 
but while the list is as varied as it is long , the chances of the majority of Eurobond hopefuls tapping international markets remains unclear . 
some regions , like the autonomous Tatarstan republic , have scaled back plans with the approach of initial bold deadlines , while others , like the southern Mary El republic , have dropped them altogether , unsure of their ability to guarantee the loans . 
more important , the federal government , wary of being lumbered with bad regional debt later , has adopted a cautious approach to regional administrations . 
Moscow , St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod received permission to issue bonds only following a presidential decree , and appeared to have been chosen as Russia &apos;s three most economically stable and forward-looking cities . 
the race to issue cheap credit has also prompted warnings that the market will be swamped , but in Komi , as in the Sverdlovsk , Samara , Irkutsk and Perm regions and the republic of Sakha , preparations are quietly continuing . 
officials say Komi &apos;s natural wealth -- it is rich in oil , coal and timber -- makes it as likely a Eurobond candidate as any . 
&quot; I think that Western entrepreneurs are very interested in Komi Republic as a region for raw materials , where they can put money in and get a payback , &quot; said Zakharov .
