Gulf states must develop a strategy to attract foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to help diversify their oil-based economies , the Gulf Organisation for Industrial Consulting ( GOIC ) said . 
GOIC -- which advises governments of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) on economic policy -- said in a report they needed to improve their investment climate to attract FDI flows and encourage the repatriation of some $ 200 billion in Gulf capital invested in the United States and Europe . 
&quot; The GCC authorities must ... develop a well-defined strategy and identify the foreign investing companies whose strategies are in harmony with their own , &quot; Doha-based GOIC said . 
it said the Gulf states -- Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Oman , Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates and Qatar -- received only $ 1.2 billion of over $ 300 billion in FDI flows in 1995 . 
&quot; There is an increasing competition among countries for a greater share of FDI . 
the countries which can offer secure and sound investment opportunities are likely to be the largest recipients , &quot; it said .
