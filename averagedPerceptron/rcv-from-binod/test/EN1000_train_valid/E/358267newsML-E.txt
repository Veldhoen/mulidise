the Federal Reserve winds up a two-day policy-making meeting on Wednesday amid widespread expectations it will decide to hold interest rates steady . 
&quot; We see no change in policy , &quot; said Jonathan Bassile , of Wall Street firm HSBC Markets Inc . &quot; inflationary pressures haven &apos;t really emerged . 
many analysts , though , believe that it is only a matter of time before the U.S. central bank tightens credit . 
with the job market taut and wages picking up , they said the Fed will eventually need to raise rates to keep inflation in check . 
U.S. bond prices rose modestly in light trading on Monday on hopes that the Fed will stand pat on interest rates . 
stock prices ended mixed . 
the central bank &apos;s key Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to resume its meeting at 9 : 00 a.m. ( 1400 GMT ) on Wednesday . 
the Fed has held rates steady for over a year , since cutting them by a quarter percentage point on Jan . 31 , 1996 . 
the federal funds rate that commercial banks charge each other for loans now stands at 5.25 percent . 
the discount rate the Fed charges on its loans to the banks is 5 percent . 
fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told state governors on Sunday he saw no evidence of significant price pressures in the economy , Iowa Gov. 
Terry Branstad said . 
&quot; He gave a positive report . 
we &apos;ve had growth with low inflation , &quot; Branstad told reporters after the governors &apos; closed-door meeting with the Fed chief . 
the economy ended 1996 with a bang , growing at a 4.7 percent annualized rate in the final three months of the year . 
that was more than double the pace of the previous quarter and the fastest rate of growth in 2-1 / 2 years . 
but inflation remained benign . 
the so-called implicit price deflator that measures price changes rose at a mere 1.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter , the slowest pace since 1967 . 
&quot; The economy has retained considerable vigour , with few signs of the imbalances and inflationary tensions that have disrupted past expansions , &quot; Greenspan told lawmakers last month . 
but he also warned of the risk of higher inflation in the future and said the Fed needed to be ready to act to contain price pressures once they started to show signs of building . 
at their meeting this week , Fed policymakers were also scheduled to discuss their projections for economic growth , inflation and unemployment this year for presentation by Greenspan to Congress later this month . 
several Fed policymakers have already said publicly that they expect moderate economic growth this year in the two to 2-1 / 2 percent range . 
on a fourth quarter on fourth quarter basis , the economy grew by 3.4 percent last year . 
but Chris Varvares , President of macroeconomic Advisers of St. Louis , said there is a risk that inflation will pick up this year even if growth moderates because the economy is already running at such high level of capacity . 
that eventually may prove enough to convince the Fed to take out some &quot; monetary insurance &quot; and raise interest rates a notch . 
but that will not happen until it can draw a better reading of where the economy -- and inflation -- is headed , he said .
