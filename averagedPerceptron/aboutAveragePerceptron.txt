Data format for training the averaged perceptron with the code form Klementiev:

A document with on each line an example: first the label, and then a vector representing the document.
The code was designed to learn a single topic for each document, but we can use it for binary classification per class (positive/ negative). In this way, we can use it for the TED classification data as well.
