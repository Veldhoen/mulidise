%New approach: based on par2vec (2 flavors)

Using the paragraph2vec dbow setting, we obtain sentence embeddings for parallel sentences. 

In one experimental setting, we take the document representation to simply be the average of its sentence embeddings. In this way, we test the quality of the multilingual sentence embeddings.

In another set-up, we use the sentence embeddings to obtain word embeddings. A word representation is the average of the embeddings of all sentences it occurs in. 

We used the latter word representations to initialize the multilingual DM setting.
